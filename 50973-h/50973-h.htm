<h2><i>THE RARITY OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_W.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Would</span>
it not be useful to ask ourselves the
question whether we are forgetting the true
meaning of "charity" in the constant endeavour
to take advantage of organized benevolent
institutions, about the actual working of which we
concern ourselves very little? As the years go on, and
what we call civilisation advances, are we or are we not
losing sight of "our neighbour" in a long vista of vicarious
benefactions, bestowed through the medium of a subscription
list, or casual contributions at an "anniversary
festival?"</p>

<p>At the speeches that are made on such occasions,
when the banquet is over, and the reading of the
amounts subscribed is accompanied by the cracking of
nuts and a crescendo or decrescendo of applause, in proportion
to the liberality of the donors, we are so frequently
reminded of "the good Samaritan," that we begin to feel
that we may claim some kind of relationship to him; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
may shake our heads with solemn sorrow at the inexcusable
conduct of the priest and the Levite. It would
be worth while, however, to ask ourselves whether we
quite come up to the mark of him who, finding the man
wounded and helpless by the wayside, dismounted that
he might convey the sufferer to the nearest inn; poured
out oil for his wounds and wine for his cheer; left him
with money in hand for the supply of his immediate
needs; and did not scruple&mdash;with a robust and secure
honesty&mdash;even to get into debt on his behalf: since the
crown of good-will would be the coming again to learn
of the patient's welfare. The debt was a pledge of the
intention.</p>

<p>That was the Lord Christ's way of looking at charitable
responsibility, and at benevolent effort; and even
granting that He illustrated the answer to the question,
"Who is my neighbour?" by an extreme case of sudden
distress, the longer we look at the peculiar needs of the
man who was on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho, the
more perhaps we shall be convinced that there are greater,
far greater evils, and more terrible accidents, than to fall
among thieves, who temporarily rob, strip, and disable
their victim.</p>

<p>The present fashion of dealing with such an unfortunate
traveller would very much depend on which particular
class of philanthropists the modern Samaritan
who found him by the road-side happened to belong to.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be a scandal to our Christianity
to follow either priest or Levite, although our cowardly
sympathies might lie between the two; so, in order to
make all safe, we hit on a compromise, and, according
to our circumstances, try to find a medium line of conduct
between Samaritan and Levite, or Samaritan and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
priest. We are ashamed to pass on without doing something,
and so we call at the inn on our way, and leave
the twopence there, in case anybody else should think
fit to bring on the man who is lying, stunned and bleeding,
in the roadway. Or else, having contrived to rouse
the poor fellow to a little effort, we borrow an ass and
take him back with us, to find some organised institution
for the relief of those who fall among thieves, where the
wine and oil are contracted for out of the funds. And
there we leave him, without remembering anything
whatever about the twopenny contribution which would
represent our own share in the benefaction.</p>

<p>It is an awful thought, and one which it may be hoped
will soon become intolerable, that, with the mechanical
perfection of means for relieving the necessities of those
who are afflicted, there seems to grow upon us a deadly
indifference to the very deepest need of all&mdash;that personal,
human sympathy, without which all our boast
of benevolence is but as the sounding of brass and the
tinkling of a cymbal. Can it be possible that we are
approaching a condition when, refusing to have the poor
and the afflicted, the widow and the orphan always with
us, we shut them away out of our sight, leaving the whole
duty of visiting them, of clothing them, of giving them
meat and drink, to be done by an official committee; a
charitable board, distributing doles, exactly calculated,
on a carefully devised scale, and divided to the ounce or
the inch, in supposed proportion to the individual need
of each recipient? Will there ever come a time when
we shall persuade ourselves that we fulfil the law of
Christ by paying so much in the pound for a charity
rate, and leaving all the actual "relief" to be effected by
an official department, or a series of official committees?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
The present aspect of charitable administration would
be truly appalling if this were likely to be the result, for
there are far too many evidences of that deadly indifference
which will get rid of all real personal responsibility
by paying a subscription, and will pay handsomely, too,
at the same time smiling grimly, and half satirically, at
the recollection that there are a number of people who
always have on hand "cases," of whom they are anxious
to rid themselves by placing them in any institution that
will receive them without payment.</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that these latter words of mine
are intended to apply to those workers among the poor,
who, with small means of their own, cannot do much
more than speak words of advice and comfort, and give
their earnest help to better the condition of sordid homes
and of neglected children. There are scores of true,
tender-hearted women who, spending much time amongst
the sick and the afflicted, feel their hearts sink within
them as they see how much more might be done, if they
had but the wherewithal to appease the actual physical
needs of those to whom they try to come spiritually
near.</p>

<p>If but the miracle so easy to others were first performed,
and the five thousand fed, then indeed might
follow that still greater miracle, the earnest listening of
the once turbulent multitude to the words of the Bread
of Life.</p>

<p>But there are those who pursue what they regard as
"charitable work" as an excitement&mdash;an amusement&mdash;just
as children are sometimes set to play with Scripture
conversation cards, and puzzles out of the Old Testament,
with a kind of feeling that the employment comes
nearly to a religious exercise. There is as much danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
of these persons missing the true work of charity as there
would be in the employment of paid officials&mdash;indeed,
the latter would have one advantage; they would be
less likely to be imposed upon by those who to obtain
some special advantage would cringe and flatter.</p>

<p>The first great difficulty in visiting and temporarily
relieving the lower class of destitute poor, is to disabuse
their minds of an inveterate notion that the
benevolent visitor and distributor is paid by some
occult society, of which the recipients of bounty know
nothing, and for which they care very little. Unfortunately,
the sharp determined amateur visitor, who
"does a district" as other people with leisure do a flower
show or a morning concert&mdash;but, alas! these very
words of mine show how common is that lack of true
charity of which I designed to speak. Who am I that
I should sum up the disposition and the heart of my
brother or my sister? Only I would say that this suspicion
on the part of the ignorant poor, which is so often
complained of&mdash;the notion that their interviewers are
paid for the work of charity&mdash;can only yield to the conviction
that the work itself is undertaken with warm
living human sympathy. Before the true relief shall
come to any man, it must come by faith. "With the
heart man believeth unto righteousness," and <i>in</i> righteousness
also.</p>

<p>The two tendencies that are driving us away from
charity to a kind of selfish economy, are the habit of
"relieving our overcharged susceptibilities by secreting
a guinea," and thinking we have thereby fulfilled the
claims of religion and humanity, and the practice of
going about seeking where we may find candidates for
other people's guineas, and so becoming a kind of charitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
detectives, with an eye to reputation and advancement
in the force.</p>

<p>We are forgetting that heartfelt sympathy, that clasp
of the hand and beam of the eye which will make even
a cup of cold water a benefaction, if we have no more
to give, or if the need goes no further than a refreshing
draught, that shall be turned from water into wine by
the power of loving fellowship. Or we may be saying,
"Be ye clothed, and be ye fed," trusting to some other
hand to do the necessary work, without having ourselves
first wrought for the means of taking our part in it,
either by a deep personal interest in the relieving institution
or in the destitute recipient.</p>

<p>"Yet one thing thou lackest,"&mdash;even though out of
thy great possessions a large proportion is given to the
poor; "follow thou me." "Go about doing good," do not
think to have fulfilled the law without love&mdash;that which
you call charity; the mere <i>giving</i>&mdash;is but to offer a stone
when bread is required of you, unless it be done with
love in your heart&mdash;personal, human, and therefore
Divine love. "If ye have not been faithful in that
which is another man's, who shall give you that which
is your own?" Use the benefits of institutions&mdash;even
though you use them only for others&mdash;as you would
use your own property. Recommend only cases that
are known to you to be worthy and necessitous, and,
should the institution depend on voluntary support,
let a contribution accompany your "case," if you can
any way afford it, as an act of justice as well as of
mercy.</p>

<p>Don't join in the traffic in votes, and never go begging
for "proxies," in order to have an exchangeable stock
on hand, that you may secure a candidate for any particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
institution. This kind of gambling is a cancer
that is eating the heart out of genuine, pure, charitable
effort, and is making way for the cold impersonal system
of distribution, which is now being advocated by those
who would make the relief of human wretchedness and
distress a mechanical organisation without the soul of
love. At the same time, let us not forget that no charitable
effort which would be efficacious in affording relief
to the widely-spread distress by which we are surrounded,
could be even so much as attempted without
associations established for the express purpose of relieving
particular forms of suffering. This, indeed, is
the glory of our country, that humanity is so strong
among us as to lead us not only to combine, but to emulate.
The absolute concentration and centralization of
charitable effort would be a calamity. The breaking up
of the best of our institutions, which have grown from
small beginnings in almsgiving into wide and influential
centres of benevolent effort, would be destruction.</p>

<p>If anything that may be written hereafter concerning
some representative (large and small, but still truly
representative) efforts to do the work that Christianity
demands as its first evidence of reality, should lead to a
deeper and wider personal interest in their behalf, it will
be matter for rejoicing. The larger the number of people
who ask what is being done, the greater will be the desire
to continue the good work, or to declare it. The attention
that might in this way be directed to the mode of
affording relief would exercise so keen an influence in
the reformation of abuses, and the adoption of improvements,
that all our charities would soon become truly
"public." With the more earnest conviction of the duty
of personal inquiry, and real sympathetic interest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
individual well-being of our poorer brother or sister,
would come the satisfaction that we belonged to an
association, or to a chain of associations, which will
afford to him or to her the very relief which otherwise
we should despair of securing.</p>

<p>I purpose in another chapter to ask you to read the
story of an institution that was in its day wonderfully
illustrative, and even now serves to take us back for two
centuries of history. Only yesterday I was speaking to
some of its inmates. One of them had nearly completed
her own century of life, most of them had seen
far more than the threescore years and ten which we call
old age; but they come of a wonderful race, the men of
fire and steel; the women of silent suffering&mdash;the old
Huguenots of France.</p>

<h2><i>WITH THE CHILDREN OF THE STRANGER.</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">A hundred</span>
and eighty-seven years ago a
French army invaded England and effected
a landing at various places on the coast.
Smaller divisions of that army had previously
obtained a footing in some of the chief towns of Great
Britain; and for about fifty years afterwards other contingents
arrived at intervals to find the compatriots
settled among the people, who had easily yielded to their
address and courage, and by that time were apparently
contented to regard them as being permanently established
in the districts of which they had taken possession.
The strange part of the story is, that for a large part of
this time England was successfully engaged in war with
the country of the invaders, and not only with that
country, but with a discarded prince of its own, who,
having received assistance from France, strove to regain
the throne which he had abdicated by raising civil war in
Ireland. Then was to be seen a marvellous thing. A
detachment of the French army of occupation in England
went with King William to the Boyne, and when the
mercenaries who were at the back of James in his miserable
enterprise came forth to fight, they beheld the
swords of their countrymen flash in their faces, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
heard a well-known terrible cry, as a band of veteran
warriors cut through their ranks, fighting as they had
been taught to fight in the Cevennes and amidst the
valleys and passes of Languedoc. For the army that
invaded England in 1686, and for four or five years afterwards,
was the army of the French Huguenots, against
whom the dragoons of Louis XIV. and the emissaries of
Pope and priests had been let loose after the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>Four hundred thousand French Protestants had left
their country during the twenty years previous to the
revocation of that pact, which had been renewed after the
siege of Rochelle, and though the attempt to escape from
the country was made punishable by the confiscation of
property and perpetual imprisonment in the galleys, six
hundred thousand persons contrived to get out of France,
and found asylums in Flanders, Switzerland, Holland, Germany,
and England, after the persecutions were resumed.</p>

<p>Comparatively few of the men who came in the second
emigration had fought for the religion that they professed.
They had learned to endure all things, and
with undaunted courage many of them had suffered
the loss of their worldly goods, the burning of their
houses, hunger, poverty, and the imprisonment of their
wives and daughters in distant fortresses, because they
would not forswear their faith. Hundreds of their companions
were at the galleys, hundreds more had been
tortured, mutilated, burned, broken on the wheel.
Women as well as men endured almost in silence the
fierce brutalities of a debased soldiery, directed by
priests and fanatics, who had, as it were, made themselves
drunk with blood, and seemed to revel in cruelty. With
a resolution that nothing seemed able to abate, pastors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
like Claude Brousson went from district to district, living
they knew not how, half famished, in perpetual danger,
and with little expectation of ultimately escaping the
stake or the rack. Nay, they refused to leave the
country, while in the woods and wildernesses of the Gard
great congregations of their brethren awaited their
coming, that they might hold services in caves and "in
the desert," as they called that wild country of the
Cevennes and of Lozére. These men were non-resistants.
They met with unflinching courage, but without
arms. Those of them who remained in France stayed to
see the persecutions redoubled in the attempt to exterminate
the reformed faith. They were the truest vindicators
of the religion that they professed. Up to the
time of the siege of Rochelle, and afterwards, Protestantism
was represented by a defensive sword, but these
men discarded the weapons of carnal warfare. Only
some years later, when the persecutors (rioting in the
very insanity of wrath because their declaration that
Protestantism was abolished was falsified by constant
revivals of the old Huguenot worship) directed utter extermination
of the Vaudois, did the grandeur of the non-resisting
principle give way before the desperation of men
who came to the conclusion that, if they were to die,
they might as well die fighting.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that some of them knew well
how to fight. Some of their leaders&mdash;men of peace as
they were, and men of an iron determination, which was
shown in the obstinacy with which they refused to take
up the sword&mdash;had come of stern warriors and were
<i>Frenchmen</i>&mdash;Norman Frenchmen&mdash;Protestant Norman
Frenchmen. A rare combination that;&mdash;cold hard steel
and fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
But it was not till some time afterwards that these men
became the leaders of the peasantry, the chestnut-fed
mountaineers who came down from their miserable huts
and joined what had then become an organised army
of insurrection. Before this time arrived a strange
aberration seemed to move the people. The old simple
non-resisting pastors had been done to death by torture
and execution, and the people met, it is true, but often
met amid the ruin of their homes, or in desert places,
and as sheep having no shepherd. Then a wild hysterical
frenzy appeared among them. Men, women, and
even children claimed to be inspired, and at length fanaticism
leaped into retaliation. On a Sunday in July,
1702, a wild mystic preacher, named Séguier went down
with a band of about fifty armed men to release the prisoners.
They were confined in dungeons beneath the
house of one Chayla, a priest, who directed the prosecutions,
and invented the tortures which he caused to be
inflicted for the conversion of heretics. The Protestants
broke open his door, forced the prison, and ultimately set
fire to the house, in attempting to escape from which
Chayla was recognised and killed. This was the beginning
of a series of retaliations by the tormented people,
the success of which changed the whole attitude of the
Protestants of the district. They had formerly endured
in silence; now they were desperate enough for insurrection.
And the insurrection followed. Séguier was
captured, maimed, and burnt alive; but others took his
place. The war of the "Camisards" had commenced.
Then it was that the leaders of the Protestant army in the
Cevennes arose;&mdash;Roland and Cavalier, and the men who
for a long time waged successful warfare against the royal
forces, till defeat came accompanied by a new <i>régime</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
The rumbling of the revolutionary earthquake was
already shaking the throne and the persecuting church.
Voltaire, educated by the Jesuits, and hating religion,
was helping to deliver the martyrs of the Protestant
faith even before he began to "philosophise."</p>

<p>The struggle of the Camisards can only be said to have
ceased when the persecutions were nearly at an end, and
France itself was tottering. But what of that great
Huguenot contingent which had invaded Britain, and was
growing in number year by year as the <i>émigrés</i>, leaving
houses and land, shops, warehouses, and factories, fled
across the frontier, or got down to the shore, and came
over the sea in fishing-boats and other small craft, in
which they took passage under various disguises, or were
stowed away in the holds, or packed along with bales of
merchandise, to escape the vigilance of the emissaries
who were set to watch for escaping Protestants? It is a
little significant that of these non-combatant Protestants
eleven regiments of soldiers were formed in the English
army; but the truth is that of the vast number of <i>émigrés</i>
who left France, some 30,000 were trained soldiers
and sailors, and doubtless a proportion of these came to
England, though probably fewer than those of their number
who served in the Low Countries. At any rate, in
1687, two years after the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes, there arrived in England 15,500 refugees, some
of whom brought with them very considerable property,
and most of them were men of education, or skilled in
the knowledge of the arts, or of those manufactures and
handicrafts which are the true wealth of a nation. At
Norwich and Canterbury they quickly formed communities
which became prosperous, and helped the prosperity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
of the districts, where they set up looms, and dyeworks,
and other additions to the local industries. In London
they formed two or three remarkable colonies, so that
when Chamberlain wrote his "Survey of London,"
there were about twenty French Protestant churches, the
greater number of which stood in Shoreditch, Hoxton,
and Spitalfields&mdash;in fact, above 13,000 emigrants had
settled in or near the metropolis. The one French Protestant
church founded by Edward VI. was, of course,
inadequate to receive them, and their immediate necessities
were so great that a collection was made for their
relief, and a sum of 60,000<i>l.</i> was by this means obtained
in order to alleviate their distress.</p>

<p>Among these <i>émigrés</i> were many noblemen and gentlemen
of distinction, who, with their wives, were reduced to
extreme poverty by the confiscation of their property.
These had learned no trade, but with characteristic
courage many of them set themselves to acquire the
knowledge of some craft by which they might earn
their bread, while some of their number learned of their
wives to make pillow-lace, and so continued to support
themselves in decent comfort.</p>

<p>To those who knew the "old French folk," as they came
to be called in after years, when the later emigration had
again increased the number of the weavers' colony in
Spitalfields, nothing was more remarkable than the cheerfulness,
one might almost say the gaiety, that distinguished
them. Reading the account given by French writers of
the old Huguenots in France, one might be disposed to
regard them as stern and sour sectaries, but that would
be a very erroneous opinion. Perhaps the sudden
freedom to which they came, the rest of soul, and the
opportunity to endeavour to serve God with a quiet mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
raised them to a tranquil happiness which revived the
national characteristic of light-heartedness; but however
it may have been, the real genuine old French
weaver of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green was a very
courteous, merry, simple, child-like gentleman. The
houses in which these people lived, some of which are
still to be seen with their high-pitched roofs and long
leaden casements, were very different to the barely-furnished,
squalid places in which their descendants of
to-day are to be found; and, indeed, the Spitalfields
weaver even of seventy years ago was usually a well-to-do
person; while in the old time he could take "Saint
Monday" every week, wear silver crown-pieces for buttons
on his holiday coat, and put on silk stockings on
state occasions. This was in the days when French was
still spoken in many of the little parlours of houses that
stood within gardens gay with sweet-scented blooms of
sweet-william, ten-weeks-stock, and clove-pink. When
there was still an embowered greenness in "Bednall,"
and Hare Street Fields were within a stone's throw of
"Sinjun"&mdash;St. John, or rather St. Jean Street,&mdash;or of
the little chapel of "<i>La Patente</i>," in Brown's Lane,
Spitalfields. Even in later times than that, however, I
can remember being set up to a table, and shown how
to draw on a slate, by an old gentleman with a face
streaked like a ruddy dried pippin. I was just old
enough to make out that the tea-table talk was in a
strange tongue; but I can remember that there were
evidences of the refinements that the old refugees had
brought with them across the sea. Not only in their
neat but spruce attire, in their polite grace to women, in
their easy, good-humoured play and prattle to little
children, in their cultivation of flowers, their liking for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
birds, and their taste for music, but in a score of trifling
objects about their tidy rooms, where the click of the
shuttle was heard from morning to night, these old
French folk vindicated their birth and breeding. By
tea-services of rare old china, rolls of real "point" lace,
a paste buckle, an antique ring, a fat, curiously-engraved
watch, a few gem-like buttons, delicately-coloured porcelain
and chimney ornaments; by books and manuscript
music, or by flute and fiddle deftly handled in the playing
of some old French tune, these people expressed
their distinction without being aware of it. It has not
even yet died out. Unfortunately, many of their descendants&mdash;representatives
of a miserably paid, and now
nearly superseded industry&mdash;have deteriorated by the
influences of continued poverty; and even so long ago
as the evil war-time of Napoleon I., many of the old
families anglicised their names in deference to British
hatred of the French, but there are still a large number
of people in the eastern districts of London whose names,
faces, and figures alike proclaim their origin.</p>

<p>But we must go back once more to the time when the
great collection was made. It is at least gratifying to
know that the £60,000 soon increased to £200,000, and
was afterwards called the "Royal Bounty," though
Royalty had nothing to do with it during that reign.
In 1686-7 about 6000 persons were relieved from this
fund, and in 1688 27,000 applicants received assistance,
while others had employment found for them, or were
relieved by more wealthy <i>émigrés</i> who had retained or
recovered some part of their possessions. But there
were still aged and sick people, little children, widows,
orphans, broken men, homeless women, and lonely
creatures who had become almost imbecile or insane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
through the cruelties and privations that they had suffered.
For these a refuge was necessary, and at length&mdash;but
not till 1708&mdash;an institution was founded in St.
Luke's, under the name of the French Hospital, but
better known to the "old folks" as the "Providence."</p>

<p>Of what it was and is I design to tell in another
chapter.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">That</span>
great invading French army of nobles,
gentry, artists, traders, handicraftsmen, of
which some account has already been given,
was added to from time to time, even as
lately as the Revolution, and the restoration of the
dynasty after the downfall of Napoleon, when a strange
reaction against the Protestants was commenced, partly
as a pretence for concealing political animosity. The
department of the Gard was once more the scene of horrible
atrocities, against which Lord Brougham invoked
the aid of the English Parliament, and obtained the help
of Austrian bayonets to protect the people, who were
being murdered, tortured, or outraged, in defiance of
feeble local authorities. But by this time there was a
new generation of the first great Anglo-French colony
in London. Spitalfields had grown to the dimensions
of a township. Bethnal had begun to lose its greenness.
There was, as there still is, a remarkable settlement
about Soho. "Petty France" was as well known as the
exhibition of needlework in Leicester Square, or Mrs.
Salmon's wax figures in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>Those poor refugees who fled to escape from the horrors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
of Sainte Guillotine, or the ruthless cruelties at
Nismes, came to brethren many of whom had never
seen the glowing valleys and golden fields of Languedoc,
whence their forefathers escaped only with life and hands
to work. They had preserved their national characteristics;
they attended churches and chapels where the
pastors still spoke their native tongue, and where they
had established schools for their children; but they
had settled down to a quiet, though a busy life, in the
heart of the great workshop of the world, and only a
few of them&mdash;principally the gentry, some of whom had
regained a portion of their property&mdash;felt frequent or
urgent impulses to return. More than a hundred and
twenty years had elapsed since the "Royal Bounty" had
been expended in the relief of the 27,000 <i>émigrés</i> who yet
were without any permanent refuge for the destitute, the
sick, the aged, and the insane among their number.
This was in 1688, and it was not till nearly twenty-eight
years afterwards that any regular institution was
organized. The earlier refugees had become aged or
had died, after having obtained such temporary help as
could be afforded by subscriptions or the large benefactions
of their more wealthy fellow-countrymen. Still,
the later emigrations increased the number of applicants
for permanent relief. At last, in 1718, a great concourse
of French refugees assembled in a chapel which formed
a special portion of a building only just completed, but
which had already received the dignity of forming the
subject of a Royal charter granted by His Majesty
King George I. to his "right trusty and right well-beloved"
cousin, Henry de Massue, Marquis de Ruvigny,
Earl of Galloway, and a number of trusty and well-beloved
gentlemen, all naturalized refugees, who made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
the first governor and directors of the "Hospital for
Poor French Protestants and their descendants residing
in Great Britain;" otherwise known as the French Hospital,
but soon to be spoken of with simple pathetic
brevity as "La Providence."</p>

<p>The idea of founding such a charity was due to a distinguished
refugee in Holland&mdash;no less a personage than
M. de Gastigny, Master of the Hounds to Prince William
of Orange; a ruddy, jovial-looking gentleman
withal, whose portrait, should you go to see it, will set
you wondering whether he could ever have been classed
among the "sour sectaries" to whom it was the fashion
to attribute a disregard of social pleasures. A bequest
of a thousand pounds sterling from the bluff keeper of
the kennels was to be divided into equal sums&mdash;£500
for the building, and the interest of the remaining £500
to be spent on its maintenance.</p>

<p>Not a very adequate provision, truly, for any such
purpose; but sufficiently suggestive to set the more
prosperous members of the great Anglo-French colony
to increase the amount. The astute Master of the
Hounds must surely have foreseen this result when he
left this legacy to the management of the trustees of the
already existing relief fund, still miscalled "the Royal
Bounty." They exhibited that prudence in money
matters which is a French characteristic, and let the
thousand pounds accumulate for eight years, after which
a general subscription was invited from successful merchants
and traders, while with a just appreciation of the
benefits which had been conferred by these good citizens
on the land of their adoption, some wealthy Englishmen
added their contributions to the general fund.</p>

<p>Thus it came about, that a piece of land was purchased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
in the Golden Acre&mdash;a queer old half-countrified
precinct of St. Giles, Cripplegate&mdash;that a building was
erected for the reception of eighty poor persons, that a
charter was granted, and that the new charitable association
was consecrated in the new chapel by Philippe
Menard, the minister of the French Church of St.
James's and secretary of the enterprise.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, something worth working for. The
aged or afflicted poor among the refugees were no longer
mere mendicants living on precarious alms. Out of their
abundance the more prosperous gave cheerfully. In
1736 another adjoining site was purchased, and another
side of the great open quadrangle of garden ground was
built upon, so that by 1760 the "Providence" numbered
230 inmates. This, however, was its culminating point
of usefulness. Religious persecution had diminished,
and at length may be said to have ceased altogether.
Even as early as 1720 only 5000 persons required relief
from the "Bounty," so that eventually the trustees were
enabled to devote part of it to the assistance of those
who fled from the Revolution&mdash;many of whom were the
descendants of those who had been the persecutors of
the Protestants. The great industrial colony, prudent,
temperate, and industrious, had almost grown beyond its
earlier needs&mdash;and all that it required was that some
adequate provision should be made for infirm or aged
men and women, who being widowed or unmarried, and
without means of support, required a refuge in which
they might peacefully end their days. The same causes
which had diminished the number of applicants had also
reduced the amount of current subscriptions, so that
some portion of the building was removed, as being no
longer necessary, and in order to secure a sufficient endowment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
an Act of Parliament was obtained, empowering
the directors to let their land on building leases. By
that time the neighbourhood was known not as "the
Golden Acre," but as St. Luke's, and on the ground once
purchased by the Marquis de Ruvigny and his trusty and
well-beloved companions, grew Radnor Street, Galway
Street, Gastigny Place, and part of Bath Street, while
the number of inmates was reduced to sixty&mdash;that is to
say, about twenty men and forty women, all of whom
were to be above sixty years of age, of French extraction,
and professing the Protestant religion. It was a
queer old range of building, that retreat; pleasant
enough, perhaps, when as a rather blank series of red
brick houses, it looked across its own formal walled
garden to the pleasant fields and open country, but
strangely silent, and with a crumbling, dreary look about
it, when the lunatic asylum of St. Luke's dominated all
the surrounding tenements of a crowded, sordid neighbourhood.
Only the initiated could easily find the little
low black door that opened in the bare wall, and led to
the large irregular space, which was laid out in weedy
beds and stony borders, distinguished by an air of decay
rather than of production&mdash;especially where in certain
dank corners a tangle of sapless stalks and tendrils indicated
some faintly hopeful attempt to rear an arbour, in
which persons of robust imagination might fancy they
were sheltered from impending blacks that issued from
the manufactory chimneys close by. The visitor to this
out-of-the-way corner of the great city, seeing the old
people walking up and down the paved causeway in
front of the row of crooked-paned lower windows, or
airing themselves at the doorsteps, might be excused for
the fancy that they had the imaginative faculty of children;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
and were expected to "make believe" a good
deal before they could quite reconcile themselves to the
notion that this dingy area of quadrilateral plots and
paths, in which the wet stood in small puddles, was ever
a "pleasaunce" gay with garden blooms, and smelling of
knotted marjoram and fragrant thyme. Yet there were
still evidences of the invincible cheerfulness of the old
French nature, among the old creatures with faces
streaked like winter apples, and hands which, even
though they trembled, were swift of gesture and of emphasis.</p>

<p>There were old fellows there who had still about them
indications of true comeliness and grace that distinguished
them from all vulgar surroundings;&mdash;ancient
gentlemen, who would go out on wet days to sweep
away any rainpools that might lie before the doors of
the old ladies, and so besmirch an otherwise immaculate
shoe. It should be remembered, too, that there was no
livery there. Those who had some one to help them to
the garb of gentility wore what pleased them; those
who were dependent on the charity for clothing, were
neither bound in one pattern, nor condemned to the uniform
of poverty. Neat or lively cotton prints, or warm
stuff gowns, with proper hose and caps and kerchiefs, for
the women; plain Oxford mixture, black, steel grey, or
brown, for the men, and each one measured for his suit.
Those who entered there were not the recipients of a
dole grudgingly conceded. It was no poorhouse, but the
"Providence." Only eleven years ago there were some
evidences of the old meaning of the place in the remnants
of the antique furniture which adorned the queer
rooms. They were not wards or dormitories, but veritable
bedrooms; and each one had its own peculiarities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
even in the bedsteads with spindle posts and dimity
hangings, the boxes and cupboards, and special chairs
which distinguished it from the rest. Some of these
things had evidently been heirlooms either of the institution
or of the individual; and, indeed, the preservation
of individuality was a cheerful feature of the place,
despite its dim and somewhat dreary surroundings.</p>

<p>The Board Room was, in its way, one of the most extraordinary
apartments in London: with its tables supported
by a tangled puzzle of legs, its high-backed,
polished chairs with leather seats, worn till they reminded
one of the cover of an antique ledger bound in unfinished
calf; its wonderful old black-framed prints
representing the meetings of the Huguenots in the
Clerk's field in the times when men and women carried
their lives in their hands, and dragoons rode congregations
down and slashed them with sabres as they fell.
Its dimly-seen portraits of the noble, broad-browed,
dark-eyed Ruvigny (the first governor), who refused to
go back to France even at the invitation of the King;
of the gentle Pastor Menard, with high, capacious forehead,
and calm, strong mien; of hale, shrewd, ruddy
Gastigny; and of some men of later date, with Frenchman
written in every line of their finely-marked faces.</p>

<p>The little room set apart as a chapel&mdash;a barely-furnished
place enough, with desk and raised platform
and plain seats&mdash;was venerable because of all the meaning
that lay in its studied absence of all ornament, and
because of the significance it must once have had to
the sad-eyed men who crowded into it, some of them
thinking, perhaps, how it had come about that they
could stand there in peace and without a hand upon the
hilt of a sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
There were, even at that later time, old men and
women in the dim old building who could repeat family
legends of the emigration&mdash;for they lived to a great age,
these French folk, many of them being still alert of eye
and ear, and foot, even though they had heard the click
of the shuttle and the rattle of the loom eighty years
before.</p>

<p>Some of them have survived the old place itself; for
while they are in a new home, the ancient building has
changed, if even it be not altogether dismantled. The
leases paid good interest, and eight years ago a new
French hospital arose&mdash;away from the dingy old precinct
of the Golden Acre.</p>

<p>To see this later "Providence" aright, you must come
through the very heart of that neighbourhood which was
once the great Silk Colony, thread the bye-ways of
Poverty Market, note the tall silent houses where the
looms no longer rattle, nor the sharp whirr of the shuttle
stirs cage-birds to sing; pass across the debatable land
lying on the edge of Shoreditch, where human beings
live in sties built in the backyards of other houses, in
streets that are still with the blank silence of misery and
want. You should walk amidst pigeon and dog fanciers;
call in at certain dingy, slipshod taverns, where at night
a slouching company will meet to hear bullfinches pipe
for wagers, and where starving men and women stand
and drink away the pence that are all too few to buy
food for the starving brood at home, and so are flung
upon the sloppy counter in exchange for the drugged
drink that feels like food and fire in one. Through
Bethnal Green, with its "townships" and its "Follies,"
extending in sordid rows of tenements built to one dreary
pattern. Over districts which, only a few years ago,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
were fields and open spaces, leading to farm lands and
hedgerows, and so away to the great expanse of marsh
land where the dappled kine wade knee-deep in the lush
pastures, and the stunted pollards stand like patient
fishermen upon the river's brink.</p>

<p>Yes, the present "French Hospital"&mdash;New
Providence&mdash;was built ten years ago in the border-land
beyond the Weavers' Garden, that great garden and
pleasure-ground known as Victoria Park. It is the only
garden left to the descendants of those old craftsmen
who once dwelt in houses every one of which had its gay
plot of flowers, its rustic arbour, or its quaint device of
grotto-work, built up of oddly-shaped stones and pearl-edged
oyster-shells. Do you think there is now no
remnant of the old French folk left? Come for a stroll
among the grand beds and plantations of this East-end
playground, and you shall see. On holidays and alas!
on those days when (to use the expressive term handed
down from prosperous times) the weaver is "at play"&mdash;that
is to say, waiting for woof and weft, and so wiling
away the sad and often hunger-bringing hours&mdash;you will
see him, with his keen well-cut face, his dark appreciative
eye, his long delicate hands, his well-brushed, threadbare
coat and hat; and the mark of race is plainly to be noted
in his intensity of look and his subdued patient bearing.
He comes of a stock which had it not been of the hardiest
and the most temperate and enduring in the world, would
have disappeared a century ago. On Sunday mornings,
when the bells are sounding round about him, he is to be
met with lingering (with who shall say what inner sense
of worship) by the strange shrubs and flowering plants, or
standing with a pathetic look of momentary satisfaction
on his lean, mobile face, to mark the rare glow and gush
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
of colour made by the blooms in a "ribbon" device of
flowers on a sunny border by a dark background of
cedar. But come and see what his forefathers might
have called, in their Scripture phraseology, "the remnant
of the children of Israel;" the old inmates of that French
Hospital founded so long ago when De Ruvigny was the
"beloved cousin" of George I., and Philippe Menard
preached at St. James's; when the Duchess de la Force
brought donation after donation to the work, and Philippe
Hervart, Baron d'Huningue gave £4,000, all in one
splendid contribution, to the building fund. Could they
have seen (who knows that they have not?) this great
French château rising beyond the park palings in a
neighbourhood fast filling with houses, but still open to
the air that blows from the Weavers' Garden and from
the great expanse of land leading towards the forest, they
would have recognised the familiar style of those grand
mansions which in France succeeded the castles of the
feudal nobility when Henry Quatre was king. The high-pointed
roof with its irregularly picturesque lines, the
quaint towers and spires, the slate blue and purple, and
rosy tints of colour in slope and wall and gable; the
various combinations of form and hue changing with
every point of view, make this modern copy of the old
French château a wonderful feature in any landscape,
and the unaccustomed visitor seeing it as it stands there
in its own ornamental ground, surrounded by a quaint
wall decorated in coloured bands, wonders what can be
the meaning of a building so full of suggestion; while
if he be of an imaginative turn, he may fall into a daydream
when he peers through the gate that stands by the
porter's lodge.</p>

<p>But let us pass through this gate, and so up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
entrance-hall, and we shall seem to leave behind us not
only the Weavers' Garden, but most things English.
The hall itself, paved with encaustic tile, leads to a flight
of broad, shallow steps, beneath an arched ceiling of
variegated brick and two screen arches. These steps
conduct us at once to a central corridor, extending for the
entire length of the building, and rising to the greatest
height of the open roof of timber with its lofty skylights.
In front of us is a double stone staircase, one branch
being for the old ladies, the other for the men; and immediately
at the foot of the former division is the entrance
to the refectory, a large handsome dining-hall, where, at
two long tables, this wonderful company assemble, only
the very infirm having their meals carried to the upper
ward, where they are waited on by paid attendants.
Separate staircases are provided for the servants of the
establishment, whose rooms are in the tower above the
main wards&mdash;or rather, let us say, principal apartments,
for they are not so much wards as a series of twenty-two
large bedrooms, linen-rooms, and two bath-rooms. The
steward of the hospital, a venerable gentleman with the
courteous air and speech of some seneschal of olden
time, has also his own apartments, reached by a third
stair, his sitting-room and office occupying a space close
to the entrance. On the right of the main staircase and
at the end of the corridor is the ladies' sitting-room, a
fine high-windowed light and lofty place, admirably
warmed, as indeed all the building is, and so furnished
that at each large square table four old ladies can sit and
have not only ample space for books or needlework, but
on her right hand each can open a special separate table-drawer
with lock and key, wherein to keep such waifs
and strays&mdash;shreds, patches, skeins, and unconsidered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
trifles&mdash;as children and old women like to accumulate.
There is another day-room beside this, and a similar,
though not quite so large an apartment is provided for
the men, both rooms being furnished with sundry books
and a few sober periodicals of the day.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten though that many of the old
gentlemen have grown accustomed to the use of tobacco,
and here in the basement is a smoking-room, quite out
of the way of the ordinary sitting and dining-rooms, and
not far from the laundry and drying-rooms, which form
an important part of the establishment.</p>

<p>But, hush! there is a hymn sounding yonder in the
refectory; a hymn sung by voices, many of which are yet
fresh and clear, though the singers number more than
eighty years of life, and of life that has often been hard
and full of heaviness.</p>

<p>It is the grace before meat, and the hot joints, with the
fresh vegetables from their own garden, have just come
up from the big kitchen by means of a lift to the serving-room.</p>

<p>There are no servants to wait at table, and the family
dinner-party is a private one, inasmuch as it is the custom
here for the most active of the inmates to agree among
themselves who shall be butler, or <i>beaufetière</i>, for each day
during the week. So the dinner-time goes pleasantly
and quickly, the meat, the vegetables, and the capital
household beer, of which each man has a pint twice a
day, and each woman half a pint, being the only articles
that require serving.</p>

<p>The good old-fashioned family custom of everybody
having his or her own teapot is observed here. A great
gas-boiler stands on one side the refectory, and a row of
convenient lockers on the other; and each inmate has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
tea and coffee from the stores, while bread and butter are
also served out for consumption according to each individual
fancy, and not in rations at each meal time. Thus
those old ladies and gentlemen who have spending money,
or friends to bring them some of the little luxuries that
they so keenly appreciate, can add a relish to their breakfast
or to the evening beer.</p>

<p>We will not go in while they are at dinner, for there
are those here yet who "might have been gentlefolk"
but for the mutability of mortal affairs. Stay! here
come the old ladies, with old-fashioned curtseys, which are
more than half a bow, and not a mere vulgar "bob."
There is no mistaking some of their faces. You may see
their like in French pictures, or in old French towns still.
Some of them with eyes from which the fire had not yet
died out; with deftly-moving fingers; with a quick,
springy step; with an inherited remnant of the French
<i>moue</i> and shrug, as they answer a gentle jest about their
age and comeliness.</p>

<p>"Eighty-four; and I don't know how it is, but I don't
seem to see so well in the dark as I used. When I went
out to see my brother-in-law, I was quite glad he came
part of the way home with me."</p>

<p>"Turned eighty, but I can't get upstairs as I used to
do."</p>

<p>"You speak French, madame?"</p>

<p>"Pas beaucoup, monsieur;" this from one of the only
two actual French women now in the establishment, the
rest being lineal descendants only. The oldest, who is
now going quietly and with a very pretty dignity out of
the refectory, is ninety-four, and can not only hear a
low-toned inquiry, but answers it in a soft, pleasant
voice. She bears the weight of years bravely, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
burden has perhaps been heavy; and she speaks in a
mournful tone, as one looking forward to a mansion
among the many&mdash;to a house not made with hands, may
sometimes speak when even the grasshopper becomes a
burden.</p>

<p>As to a young person of sixty-five or thereabout, nobody
regards her as having any real business to mention
such a trifling experience of life; while of the men&mdash;most
of whom seemed to have filed off for their pipe or
newspaper&mdash;one remains finishing his dinner, for he has
been on duty for the day, and is now winding up with a
snack of bread-and-butter and the remainder of his mug
of porter&mdash;a stoutly-built, hale, stalwart-looking gentleman
who, sitting there without his coat, which hangs on
the back of a chair, might pass for a retired master
mariner, or a representative of some position requiring
no little energy and endurance. I fancy, for the moment
that he must be an official appointed to serve or carve
and employed on the establishment.</p>

<p>"Eighty-four," and one of the old weaving colony of
Bethnal Green.</p>

<p>There can be no mistake about it. Every inmate provides
certificates and registers enough to make the claim
undoubted; and as to the right by descent, half the
people here carry it in their faces, and to the initiated,
are as surely French, as they are undoubtedly weavers.</p>

<p>The morning here begins with family prayers, which
the steward reads from a desk in the refectory, and so
the day closes also. The Sunday services are in the
chapel, and such a chapel! To those who remember the
dim, barely-furnished room in the old building at St.
Luke's, this gem of architectural taste and simple beauty
at the end of the main corridor comes with no little surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
Its beautiful carved stone corbels, mosaic floor,
and charming ornamentation; its broad gallery entered
immediately from the upper floor, so that the feeble and
infirm may go to worship directly from their sleeping-rooms;
its glow of subdued colour and sobered light
from windows of stained glass; its simple decorations,
and its spotless purity, are no less remarkable than the
plainness which characterises the general effect. It is to
be noticed, too, that there is no "altar," but "a table;"
that neither at the back of the communion nor on the
carving of the lectern, nor even in the windows, is there
to be seen a cross. Where the Maltese cross would
occur amidst the arabesques of the stained glass, we see
the fleur-de-lis. French Protestantism, has perhaps, not
yet lost its intense significance, at all events here, in this
chapel where the service of the Church of England is observed,
and an ordained clergyman ministers to the family
of the children's children of the ancient persecuted people
of Languedoc, the symbol under which the Protestants
were burned and tortured and exiled has no place. This is
probably in accordance with the traditions left by De
Ruvigny, by Gastigny, by Menard, and by their successors,
whose portraits still hang in the fine board-room of
the new "Providence."</p>

<p>Of course, no contributions or subscriptions are now
asked for to support this old French charity. With it
are associated one or two gifts of money, such as that of
Stephen Mounier for apprenticing two boys; and the bequest
of Madame Esther Coqueau for giving ten shillings
monthly to ten poor widows or maidens; but the directors
do not seek for external aid. To the charity when
it was first chartered was added a portion of the accumulations
of the benefactions of the French Church at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Norwich, and it may here be mentioned that at Norwich,
where a contingent of the army of refugees had settled,
the Society of Universal Goodwill was also established
by Dr. John Murray, a good physician, who strove to
extend to a large organisation a plan for relieving distressed
foreigners. This was but ninety years ago, and
it was less successful than its promoter desired, so that
part of the funds accumulated were judiciously handed to
another admirable society in London, of which I shall
have something to say, "The Society of the Friends of
Foreigners in Distress."</p>

<h2><i>WITH THE STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_D.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Do</span>
we ever try to realise the full meaning of
the declaration that they who are afar off
shall be made near by the blood of Christ?
Surely it does not stop at the nearness to God
by redemption, for the only true redemption is Christ-likeness,
and nearness to God assumes nearness to each
other in the exercise of that loving-kindness which is the
very mark and evidence of our calling.</p>

<p>It would be well if we sometimes ceased to separate
by our vague imaginations "the next world," or "the
other world," from the present world, which is, perhaps
in a very real sense, if we could only read the words
spiritually, "the world to come" also;&mdash;as it is obvious
that the world means the people around us&mdash;ourselves,
those who are near and those who seem to be afar off;
and no world to come that could dispense with our identity
would be of any particular significance to us as human
beings.</p>

<p>Let us then, for the present purpose, try to see how
effectually Christ-likeness should bring near to us those
who are afar off, by taking us near to them; how He who
came not to destroy but to fulfil, looks to us to entertain
strangers; and to "be careful" in the performance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
that duty, as to Him who will say either, "I was a
stranger, and ye took me in," or the reverse.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present century, with the exception
of the French Protestant organisation, there
existed in London no established association for the
relief of destitute foreigners who, having sought a refuge
here, or being, as it were, thrown upon our shores, were
left in distress, hunger, or sickness,&mdash;unheeded, only
obtaining such temporary casual relief as a few charitable
persons might afford, if by any chance their necessities
were made known to them. At that time the foreign
Protestant clergy, to whom alone many of these destitute
men and women could apply for relief, were themselves
mostly the poor pastors of congregations consisting
either of refugees or of artisans and persons earning their
livelihood by precarious labour connected with the lighter
ornamental manufactures. The means at their disposal
for charitable purposes outside their own churches were
consequently very small, and they were unable to render
any really effectual assistance, even if they could have
undertaken, what would at that time have been the difficult
task of verifying the needs for which relief was
claimed.</p>

<p>Some attempt had already been made by Dr. John
Murray, a good physician of Norwich, to extend to London
the benefits of his "Society of Universal Goodwill;"
but the scheme had been only partially successful. To
him, however, the credit is due of having striven to give
definite shape to an association which was afterwards to
take up the good work of caring for strangers. The
foreign Protestant clergy settled in London met to consider
how they might best organise a regular plan for
relieving the wants of those who had so often to apply to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
them in vain; and having settled the preliminaries, which
were heartily approved by several foreign merchants, and
others, who were willing to assist in any scheme that
would include inquiry into the circumstances of those
who sought assistance, called a public meeting in order
to found a regular institution. This was on the 3rd of
July, 1806, and the result of the appeal was the formation
of the society of "The Friends of Foreigners in
Distress." By the following April, a committee had been
formed and the Charity was in working order, nor were
funds long wanting with which to commence the work in
earnest. The cases requiring relief were so numerous,
however, and the demands on the society's resources
were so constant, that though some large donations were
afterwards obtained from senates, corporations, wealthy
merchants, ambassadors, noblemen, and Royal benefactors,
a considerable subscription list became necessary
in order to enable the society to grant even partial relief
to cases, the urgent claims of which were established by
careful inquiry.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful suggestiveness in the list of
"Royal Benefactors (deceased)," headed by his late
Majesty King William IV., and her late Majesty the
Queen Dowager Adelaide. More than one of the
Royal donors themselves died in exile; and several of
those who shared their misfortunes, and were their
faithful followers, have shared the small benefits which
the Society had to bestow. "His late Majesty King
Charles X. of France" contributed £300; "His late
Majesty Louis Philippe," 100 guineas; the unfortunate
Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, £25; and his late
Imperial Majesty Napoleon III., £50: while their
Magnificencies the Senates of the Free German Towns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
as well as the humbler companies of London's citizens,
appear to have given liberally. Notwithstanding all this,
however, the Society has not been able to retain funded
property to any considerable amount, and it is to the
annual subscription list&mdash;to which our Queen contributes
£100, the Emperor of Germany £100, and the Emperor
of Austria £100&mdash;that the charity must look for
support.</p>

<p>Unhappily there are evidences that these annual subscriptions
are fewer than they should be. There seems
still to be some reluctance on the part of the general
public steadily to support an effort which has a very distinct
and pressing claim upon Englishmen, who pride
themselves, justly enough, upon the free asylum which
this country affords to foreigners, and who appear ready
to give largely in the way of occasional aid. The disparity
between the number of handsome donations and
of very moderate annual subscriptions is a painful feature
of the Society's report, and even public appeals have
hitherto been followed rather by increased applications
from persons recommending cases for relief, <i>without
accompanying the recommendation with a subscription</i>, than
by any decided augmentation of the funds. The Friends
of Foreigners in Distress are principally to be found
amongst prosperous foreigners in London, and doubtless
this is no less than just; but until larger aid is given by
the English public, we have no particular reason to
include this association in any boastful estimate of
British charity.</p>

<p>That the committee does its work carefully, and that
cases of distress are relieved only after due inquiry, and
with no such careless hand as would encourage idle dependence
or promote pauperism, is evident enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
anybody who will take the trouble to inquire into the
method of assistance. Let us go and see.</p>

<p>Perhaps not one Londoner in a thousand could tell
you offhand where to find Finsbury Chambers. It is
probably less known even than Prudent Passage, or what
was once Alderman's Walk; and may be said to be less
attractive than either, for it is a dingy, frowsy, little out-of-the-way
corner in that undecided and rather dreary
thoroughfare&mdash;London Wall. It is, in fact, a space
without any outlet, and looks as though it ought to have
been a builder's yard, but that the builder took to erecting
houses on it as a speculation which never answered,
even though they were let out as "chambers;" that is to
say, as blank rooms and sets of offices, the supposed
occupiers whereof committed themselves to obscurity by
causing their names to be painted on the doorposts, and
leaving them there to fade till time and dirt shall wholly
obliterate them.</p>

<p>And yet it is in one of these lower rooms, occupying
the ground floor of No. 10, that a good work is going on;
for here, in an office almost representatively bare and
dingy even in that place, the Society of Friends of
Foreigners in Distress holds its weekly meetings of
directors, and the secretary, Mr. William Charles Laurie,
or his assistant, Mr. C. P. Smith, gives daily attendance
(Saturdays excepted), between eleven and one o'clock.
Assuredly, the funds of the charity are not expended in
luxurious appointments for its headquarters. Even a
German commission agent just commencing business
could scarcely have a more simply-furnished apartment.
The objects which first strike the visitor's attention are a
row of japanned tin candlesticks, meant for the use of the
board at any of their Wednesday meetings which may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
be prolonged till after dusk. The furniture, if it was
ever new, must have been purchased with a regard for
economy in the very early history of the society. The
work is evidently so organised as to require no long
daily attendance. The place is furnished only according
to the temporary necessities of business quickly dispatched.
Neither in official salaries, nor in expensive
official belongings, are the funds of the institution
wasted.</p>

<p>The system is, in fact, simple enough, and is conducted
on the principles laid down by the first meetings of the
committee above seventy years ago, with one important
exception. Formerly, applicants for relief must have
been for some time resident in England; but changes in
transit, and the more rapid intercommunication of nations,
have made it necessary that some ready aid should be
granted to those who find themselves cast upon the
terrible London wilderness without a friend to help them,
ignorant to whom to apply for help, and little able even
to make known their sufferings.</p>

<p>Every Wednesday, then, the directors meet for receiving
applications for relief, and reports of cases that
have been investigated by the Visiting Committee.</p>

<p>The plan adopted is to issue to the governors of the
charity a number of small tickets, each of which, when
signed and bearing the name of the applicant for relief,
entitles the latter to apply to the weekly committee for
an investigation of his case. Every subscriber of a
guinea is regarded as a governor for a year, and there
are, of course, life governors also. Both these are entitled
to recommend cases either for what may be termed
casual relief, or for election as pensioners to receive
weekly assistance (of from 2<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, and in cases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
extreme old age or great infirmity, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week),
sick allowances, or passage money to enable applicants to
return to their own country.</p>

<p>It may easily be believed how a small weekly contribution
will often save a destitute man or woman,
or a poor family, from that utter destitution which
would result from the inability to pay rent even for a
single room; while in cases of sickness, the regular
allowance even of a very trifling sum will enable many
a poor sufferer to tide over a period of pain and weakness,
during which earnings, already small, are either reduced
or cease altogether.</p>

<p>In cases of urgent necessity four superintendents are
appointed from the board of directors, with the power
to grant immediate relief; and of course many applicants
receive temporary assistance from the governor who recommends
them, until their case is investigated by the
committee, and they are on the list of the worthy and
indefatigable "visitor."</p>

<p>After the expulsion of the Germans from Paris during the
late war, that little dingy quadrangle in London Wall was
filled with a strange crowd of lost and helpless foreigners,
whose condition would admit of only a temporary inquiry,
and indeed needed little investigation, since want and
misery were written legibly enough in their faces. For
a large number of these, passage money had to be paid,
and the relief was continued till the press of refugees
from France abated. There was a special subscription
for the relief of these poor creatures, raised chiefly
among German merchants living in London, and even
now the Society has to extend a helping hand to some
who still remain.</p>

<p>Any one wandering by accident into Finsbury Buildings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
on a Wednesday forenoon, would wonder what so many
subdued and rather anxious-looking men were waiting
about for in such an out-of-the-way locality&mdash;some of
them leaning against the wall inside, others sitting in the
bare room, just within the barer passage. Every one of
these has had his circumstances carefully inquired into,
and is in attendance to receive what may be called temporary
relief. During the official year of my latest visit 150
homeward passages had been paid, and in the two years
from 1871 to 1873 the number of persons who received relief
was 21,333, who with their wives and families represented
a considerable community of poverty. During the year
1,983 grants were made of sums varying from less than
10<i>s.</i> to 1,324 persons, 10<i>s.</i> to 431, 15<i>s.</i> to 47, £1 to 135,
and so on to £5, which was allowed in a few instances,
while sick allowances were granted in 292 cases. One important
and suggestive feature of this excellent Society is
that it numbers among its members not only subscribers to
other charitable institutions, but members of the medical
and legal professions, who frequently render their aid
to applicants free of expense, in order either to relieve
them from suffering, or to protect them from the errors
or impositions to which their ignorance and helplessness
might expose them.</p>

<p>There is no restriction either as regards creed or
nationality, and though each case is matter for inquiry,
the only persons disqualified for receiving relief are those
who are detected as impostors&mdash;persons who are deemed
to have sufficient support from any other source, those
who cannot give a good reason for having come to this
country, and proof of their having striven to obtain work
and to labour for a maintenance, those who are proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
to have been guilty of fraud or immoral practices, and
beggars, or drunken, dissolute persons.</p>

<p>As regards the numbers of persons who have received
relief since the institution was founded, there is the
tremendous total of 21,645 applicants on behalf of 129,299
individuals. What an army it represents! Of these
Germany (which till recently included Austria, Hungary,
and Bohemia) represents 71,913; Sweden and Norway,
9,422; Holland, 8,878; France, 7,339; Russia, 7,006;
Italy, 5,415; Belgium, 4,578; Denmark, 4,215; the West
Indies, 1,716; Switzerland, 1,685; and so on in a
diminishing proportion till we come to "Central Africa!"&mdash;a
very recent case, no doubt.</p>

<p>Can any one question the good that has been effected
by an institution so careful not only to relieve with rigid
economy, but also to do its work on so truly voluntary a
principle? If the temporary and comparatively casual
aid afforded to poor and destitute strangers works so
beneficially, however, the pensions, to which only very
extreme cases are elected, are even still more in the
nature of help given to those who are ready to perish,
Here are some specimen cases:</p>

<p>A watchmaker of Frankfort, seventy-four years old,
and nearly seventy years in this country, disabled by
paralysis, with a wife, who is a waistcoat maker, unable
to compete with the sewing-machine; one son, twenty
years old, who, having some small situation, lives with
them, pays the rent, and "does what he can;" a boy of
fourteen who works as an errand boy.</p>

<p>An Italian looking-glass maker, seventy-three years
old, and fifty-three years in this country. Has lately
lived by making light frames, but health and strength
fail, and he is suffering from asthma. His wife, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
Englishwoman, and aged sixty-six, works as a charwoman.
He has two sons, each married and with large
families, so that they can do nothing for him.</p>

<p>A French widow, sixty-seven years old, and thirty-two
years in this country, and paralysed for the last thirteen
years. Her only daughter who is in delicate health, earns
her "living" by needlework, but can only gain enough
for her own maintenance.</p>

<p>These are only three of the first cases in the official
report of pensioners, and they are not selected because
of their peculiarly distressing character. When it is
remembered that this society has not, in a general
way, sufficient means to grant more than <i>two shillings
a week</i> in the way of relief, and when we take the
trouble to observe that in the majority of cases where
a pension is granted the recipients have been so long
resident here that they may be said to have lost their
nationality in ours, will it be too much to ask of England&mdash;alike
the asylum for the persecuted and the teacher of
liberty and of charity&mdash;that the "Friends of Foreigners in
Distress" shall be regarded as the friends of all of us
alike in the name of Him of whom it was said, "Can any
good thing come out of Nazareth?"</p>

<p>But I have not quite done with the pensioners. I must
ask the reader to go with me to Lower Norwood, where
amidst a strange solitude, that is almost desolation, we
will visit three ladies of the <i>ancien régime</i>, one of whom,
at least, began life nearly ninety years ago as a fitting
playmate for the daughter of a king.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">There</span>
is something about the aspect of Nature
as seen from the railway station at Lower
Norwood on a damp and misty day which, if
not depressing, can scarcely be regarded as
conducive to unusual hilarity. I speak guardedly because
of my respect for the district, and lest I should in any
way be suspected of depreciating any particular locality
as an eligible place of residence. In the latter regard I
may mention that the immediate neighbourhood of Lower
Norwood Station is not at present converted into a small
township by the erection of long rows of tenements on
freehold or long leasehold plots. My remarks apply only
to the general outlook from the road, amidst an atmosphere
threatening drizzle, and beneath a sky betokening
rain. As far as houses are concerned, there seemed to
me, on the occasion of my last visit, far more probability
of pulling down than of building. In fact, I went for the
purpose of inspecting a whole series of very remarkable
tenements which I had heard were soon either to disappear
from the oozy-looking green quadrangle of which
they formed three sides, or were to be converted to another
purpose than that of the dwelling-places of a few elderly
ladies who occupied one dreary side, whence they could
look at the desolation of the closed houses on the other.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
It will not be without regret that I shall hear of this
intention being carried out, for the houses are devoted to
the sheltering of alms-folk; and the alms-folk are the
elder pensioners of that admirable association, the
Society of the Friends of Foreigners in Distress, which,
for above ninety years, has been doing its useful work
among those who, but for its prompt and judicious aid,
would feel that they were "alone in a strange land."</p>

<p>As a part of its original provision for the relief of some
of the applicants who, after long residence in this
country, had fallen into a distressed condition at an age
when they were unable any longer to maintain themselves
by their own exertions, the society instituted the
almshouses at Lower Norwood. There is now an impression
among the directors of the charity that their
intentions may be carried out in future by some better
method than placing a number of aged and frequently
infirm persons in a comparatively remote group of dwellings,
where they are peculiarly lonely, and lack frequent
personal attention and general sympathy. There can be
no doubt that almshouses have frequently been associated
a little too closely with that monastic or conventual
practice with which they mostly originated, and
that the retirement, almost amounting to seclusion, into
which the inmates of such places are removed, may be
very far from affording to the aged the kind of asylum
which they most desire. Alas, in many instances, to be
placed in an almshouse is to be put out of the way,&mdash;to
be conveniently disposed of; with the inference that
every possible provision has been made for comfortable
maintenance. Thus, susceptibilities are quieted. The
aged pensioners are supposed to be periodically visited;
their wants attended to by somebody or other who "sees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
that they are all right," and the whole matter is conveniently
forgotten, except when a casual traveller passes a
quaint, ancient, mouldy-looking, but still picturesque
block of buildings, and inquires to what charity they belong;
not without a kind of uneasy fancy that there is a
custom in this country of burying certain old people
before their time&mdash;shutting them out of the light and
warmth of every-day companionship; or, to change the
metaphor, making organised charity a kind of Hooghly,
on the tide of which the aged, who are supposed to be
nearing the end of their mortal life, are floated into
oblivion until the memory of them is revived by death.</p>

<p>It is no part of my intention to represent that the
almshouses at Lower Norwood bore such a significance,
but the conditions to which I have referred appear to be
so inevitable where places like these are concerned, that
I cannot question the good sense of the directors of
the Charity in determining to supersede them, and to
carry on the work by annual or monthly pensions
only. On behalf of the few remaining inmates of these
queer, half-deserted, and failing tenements, it was desirable
that the proposition should be acted on at once,
and a more comfortable provision be made, at least,
for those who wait on, with constantly deferred hope,
doubly heart-sickening when so little time is to be
counted on, in which something will be done before the
houses themselves, crumbling to decay, become but a type
of their own forlorn old age.</p>

<p>It is with some such thoughts as these that I stand at
the entrance to the green, with last year's weedy aftermath
still dank and tangled with wind and rain. The
queer little one-storied dark-red houses of the quadrangle
bear a melancholy resemblance to a set of dilapidated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
and discarded toys, the box for which has been lost.
They are built, too, on a kind of foreign-toy pattern, with
queer outside staircases, leading to street-doors under a
portico, which is the only entrance to the upper storey,
the lower doors in the quadrangle communicating only
with the ground-floor. The crunch of my footsteps along
the moist path, gives no echo; the place seems to be too
dull and lifeless even for that kind of response. The left
wing and far the greater portion of the centre block are
still with the silence of desertion. Peering through the
dim leaden casements, I see only small, bare, empty
rooms. There is a sense of mildew and of damp plaster
peeling from the walls,&mdash;of leaky water-pipes, and a
humid chill, which no glowing hearth nor bright July
weather could utterly subdue. Such is the feeling with
which the whole place strikes me on this leaden wintry
day, when the vapour from the engine on the railway
trails slowly upward to meet the ragged edge of the dun
cloud that streams slowly downward; when a big, black
dog crouches on the threshold of the village chandler's
shop, to get out of the drizzle; and the butcher, who has
sold out, closes his half-hatch, with the certainty that he
may take his afternoon nap by the fire, undisturbed by
customers.</p>

<p>Even when I pause before one of the little narrow
portals to which I have been directed, there are few more
signs of life, except that at the same moment I hear
other footsteps behind me, and a baker stop to deliver a
loaf. This is promising, as far as it goes, and enables me
to present myself unostentatiously, under cover of the
baker's basket, to a lady who opens the door. Unless I
am greatly mistaken, that lady has a French face, and as
it is a French lady for whom I am to inquire, I begin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
think I have come to the end of my quest. It is evident,
however, from the surprised questioning look which
greets my appearance, that visits from strangers are not
of very frequent occurrence there. I can trace in the
rather shrinking recognition accorded to my request to
see the lady to whom I bring an introduction, the sensitiveness
that belongs to that kind of poverty which has
learned to endure in seclusion reverses that would be
less bearable if they were exposed to a too obtrusive
expression of sympathy. It is a positive relief to be left
alone for a minute, standing in that narrow lobby, looking
into a room which has the appearance of a disused
scullery, while my errand is made known in another room
on the right, to which I am presently bidden. It is a
poor little place enough; poor, and little, and dim, even
for an almshouse, and scarcely suggestive of comfort
though a bright fire is burning in a grate, which somewhat
resembles a reduced kitchen-range, and though the
table which stands beneath the casement bears some preparations
for the evening meal, and the cheap luxury of
a cut orange on a plate. The walls are dim, the ceiling
cracked and discoloured by the evident overflow of water
in the room overhead; the furniture consists of a kind
of couch which may do duty for a bed by night, and of
two or three Windsor chairs, one of which has already
been placed for me. It is a poor place enough; and yet
the lady to whom I am at once introduced is ready to do
its honours with a grace and dignity that well become
her appearance and her name. Madame Gracieuse
B&mdash;&mdash;, for more than forty years resident in England,
and speaking English with a purity of accent that is only
rivalled by the more perfect music of the French in which
she addresses me, has passed the threescore years and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
ten which are counted as old age. Yet seeing her sweet,
calm face; her smooth, broad, intelligent brow; the mild,
penetrating scrutiny of her gentle eyes; the soft hair put
back under the quaint French cap, shaped like a hood;
those years remain uncounted; until, with a pleasant
smile, only just too placid for vivacity, she tells how she
came to this country in 1830, after the ruin of the fortunes
of her house by the revolution which dethroned Charles
X., and made her a governess in England, where so many
of the old nobility sought a refuge and a home.</p>

<p>But before this is said, she has presented me to a third
lady&mdash;to whom, indeed, my original introduction extended&mdash;already
long past the limit of that short period
which we call long life; for she is more than eighty years
old, and by reason of the infirmity which has lately come
upon her, does not rise to receive me, but remains seated
in the couch by the fire. It is a very limited space in
which to be ceremonious; but were this lady sitting in
one of a suite of grand rooms in some aristocratic mansion,
with all the surroundings to which her birth, her
high connections, and the recollection of her own personal
accomplishments entitle her, she might not lack the
homage which too often only simulates respect.</p>

<p>It is possible that she may long ago have learned to
assess it at its true value, for she has seen it at a court
where it could not save a king from banishment; and if
we may judge from a face with strong determined lineaments,
a brow of concentrated power, and eyes the light
of which even the recent paralysis of age has not extinguished,
she has been one who could undergo exile,
poverty, and even the sadder calamity of being forgotten,
with a wonderful endurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Yes, Madame la Comtesse Maria de Comoléra, friend
and fellow-student of that Madame Adelaide whose
name has become historical, when your father was
Monsieur l'Intendant of the Duc d'Orléans, and when you
lived within the atmosphere of the French court, spending
quiet days at the easel in your painting-room, or preparing
the delicate <i>pâte</i> of Sèvres porcelain, on which to
paint the roses and lilies that you loved, the grim visions
of exile and poverty may never have troubled you. When
the house of Bourbon crumbled, and you escaped from
the ruin it had made, you had still your art left to solace,
if not to gladden you; and for a time at least you lived
by it, and took a new rank by the work that you could
do. There were flowers in England, and your hands
could still place their glowing hues on canvas. Witness
those pictures of yours that now hang on the walls of
the gallery of the Crystal Palace, or adorn some private
collections. Witness, too, the recognition of some of our
own painters when Sir Charles Eastlake was president of
the Royal Academy, and when you found a friendly
patron in Queen Adelaide of gentle memory. Alas, the
hand has lost its cunning; and if its work is not altogether
forgotten, those who look upon it are unaware
that you are living here in this poor room&mdash;pensioner of
a charity which, were it but supported as it might be,
could better lighten your declining years. Yet I will not
call you desolate, madame. Two faithful friends are with
you yet. The sunset of your calm life, whereof the
noon was broken by so terrible a storm, is dim enough;
but it goes not down in complete darkness. Gentle and
admiring regard survives even in this dull place; and with
it the love that can bring tears to eyes not over ready
to weep on account of selfish sorrows, and can move
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
ready hands to tend you now that your own grow heavy
and feeble.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>As I become more accustomed to the subdued light of
the room, I note that amidst the confusion of some old
pieces of furniture or lumber there are pictures, unframed
and dim, leaning against the walls. One of them&mdash;a
large painting of some rare plant, formerly a curiosity in
the Botanical Gardens at Regent's Park, while the rest
are groups of flowers and fruit. Just opposite me, on
the high mantel-piece, the canvas broken here and there
near the edges, obscured by the dust and smoke that
have dulled their surface, are two oil-paintings which I
venture to take down for a nearer inspection. Surely
they must have been finished when madame was yet in
the prime of her art. Exquisite in drawing, delicate in
colour, and with a subtle touch that gives to each petal
the fresh crumple that bespeaks it newly-blown, and to
fruit the dewy down that would make even a <i>gourmet</i>
linger ere he pressed the juice. It is almost pain to think
that they are left here uncared for; and yet, who knows
what influence their presence above that dingy shelf may
have upon the wandering thoughts and waning dreams
of her who painted them when every new effort of her
skill was a keen delight?</p>

<p>Nay, even as I hold them to the light, and in a pause
of our chat (wherein Madame la Comtesse speaks slowly
and with some difficulty) say some half-involuntary words
of appreciation, she has risen, and stands upright by the fire
with an earnest look in her face and a sudden gesture of
awakened interest. The artistic instinct is there still,
after more than eighty years of life, and the appreciation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
of the work animates her yet. Not with a mere vulgar
love of praise (for Madame is still la Comtesse Comoléra
even though she spends her days in an almshouse), but
with a recognition that I have distinguished the best
of the work that is left to her to show. I shall not
readily forget the sudden look of almost eager interest,
the effort to speak generous words of thanks, as I bow
over her hand to say farewell, and feel that I have been
as privileged a visitor as though madame had received
me in a gilded <i>salon</i>, at the door of which a powdered
lacquey stood to "welcome the coming&mdash;speed the parting
guest."</p>

<p>And so with some pleasant leave-takings, and not
without permission to see them again, I leave these ladies&mdash;the
fitting representatives of an old nobility and an old
<i>régime</i>&mdash;to the solitude to which they have retired from a
world too ready to forget.</p>

<p>If by any means for the solitude could be substituted
a pleasant retirement, and for the sense of desolation
and poverty a modest provision that would yet include
some grace and lightness to light their declining days, it
would be but little after all.</p>

<h2><i>WITH THEM THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_I.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span>
is possible that those portions of the sacred
history which have reference to the association
of our Lord Jesus Christ with ships, and
the wonderful portions of the great narrative
where the Divine Voice seems, as it were, to come from
the sea, may have a special attraction for us who live in
an island and claim a kind of maritime dominion.</p>

<p>Surely the words "Lord, save me, or I perish," and the
instant response of the outstretched hand of the Saviour
of men, must have been read with an awful joy by many
a God-fearing sailor on the homeward voyage. "It is I,
be not afraid," must have come with an intensity of meaning
to many a heart which has known the peril of the
storm, wherein the voice of man to man has been almost
inaudible.</p>

<p>There is something very solemn in the prayers we send
up for those at sea. Most of us feel a heart-throb when
we lie awake listening to the mighty murmurs of the
wind, and waiting for the shrill shriek with which each
long terrible blast gathers up its forces&mdash;a throb which
comes of the sudden thought of lonely ships far out upon
the ocean, where men are wrestling with the elements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
and looking with clenched lips and straining eyes for the
lingering dawn.</p>

<p>Yet, with all this, it is a national reproach to us that
until a comparatively recent date we have done little or
nothing for our sailors&mdash;little for those who have been
ready to maintain the old supremacy of our fleet&mdash;almost
nothing for that greater navy of the mercantile marine to
which we are indebted for half the necessaries and for
nearly all the luxuries which we enjoy.</p>

<p>A national reproach, because not only have charitable
provisions for destitute, sick, infirm, or disabled sailors
been neglected, but subscriptions demanded by the State
from seamen of the merchant service were never properly
applied to relieve the distress of those for whom they
were professedly received. Considerably over a million
of money has been contributed by merchant seamen, by
deductions of sixpences from their monthly pay for the
maintenance of Greenwich Hospital, and in addition to
this there have been accumulated in the hands of the
Government the examination fees of masters and mates
passing the Board of Trade examination, and the penny
fees paid by common seamen on shipment and unshipment,
while the unclaimed wages and effects of seamen
dying abroad are calculated at about £8000 a year.</p>

<p>Now there can be no doubt that Greenwich Hospital
was originally intended to include merchant seamen in
its provisions, for the preamble to the original scheme of
William III. recites, "Whereas the King's most excellent
Majesty being anxiously desirous to promote the Trade,
Navigation, and Naval strength of this Kingdom, and to
invite greater numbers of his subjects to betake themselves
to the sea, hath determined to erect a hospital,"
&amp;c. For this purpose sixpence per man per month was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
to be paid out of the wages of all mariners to the support
of the Hospital, and every seaman was to be registered.
Why? That the charity might be "for the relief, benefit,
or advantage of such the said registered Marines, or
Seamen, Watermen, Fishermen, Lightermen, Bargemen,
Keelmen, or Seafaring Men, who by age, wounds, or
other accidents shall be disabled for future service at
sea, and shall not be in a condition to maintain themselves
comfortably; and the children of such disabled
seamen; and the widows and children of such of them
as shall happen to be slain, killed, or drowned in sea service,
so far forth as the Hospital shall be capable to receive
them, and the revenue thereof will extend."</p>

<p>So far as words went, therefore&mdash;and subsequent Acts
of Parliament confirmed them&mdash;Greenwich Hospital was
open to all registered seamen. The fact has always been,
however, that it was barely able to meet the claims made
by the disabled and infirm sailors of the Navy alone, and
therefore the mercantile marine was practically excluded,
while the payments were still demanded.</p>

<p>Now let us see what past Governments did for the relief
of those old, infirm, or disabled men who having "seen
wonders on the great deep," came home and sought help.</p>

<p>A charitable trust, called the "Merchant Seamen's
Fund," had been established by merchants and shipowners
of the City of London, who gave large sums to
it, in order to try to make up for the injustice by which
these sailors were virtually excluded from Greenwich
Hospital, to which the men of the mercantile marine still
had to pay sixpence a month. By a remarkably knowing
piece of legislation, an Act was passed (the 20th of
George II.) which incorporated the Merchant Seamen's
Fund, appointed president and governors, and gave authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
to purchase land for building a hospital, to help
pay for which another sixpence a month was claimed
from the pay of merchant seamen and masters of merchant
vessels.</p>

<p>Not till the year 1834, by an Act passed in the reign
of William IV., were the merchant sailors relieved from
compulsory payment to Greenwich. They had contributed
to the hospital for 138 years without having derived
any direct benefit from it; and though they were
not unwilling to subscribe for their brethren in the Royal
Navy, the injustice which demanded their contributions,
though their own fund was inadequate to pay for the
promised building for which it was intended, became too
glaring to be continued. It was therefore determined
that a grant of £20,000 should be made to Greenwich
Hospital out of the Consolidated Fund, and that the
merchant sailors should go on paying their shilling a
month for their own benefit (masters paying two shillings),
and that a provision for widows and children
should be included in the charity, the benefits of which
were to be extended to Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<p>The hospital never was built. The Board of Trade
taking the management of the contributions, appointed
trustees, who were altogether incompetent, and did their
duty in a perfunctory or careless manner. In 1850, only
£20,000 was distributed among old, infirm, and disabled
seamen, while £41,000 was bestowed on widows and children;
the allowances varying at different ports from £1
to £7, each place having its own local government. Of
course a collapse came. The fund was bankrupt; and
in the following year an Act was passed for winding it
up&mdash;for, says the Board of Trade Report, "the Government
has had no control over the matter. The London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
Corporation and the trustees of outports could not by
any management have prevented the insolvency of the fund,
as long as they were guided by the principles which the
several Acts of Parliament laid down ... the whole
system was vicious."</p>

<p>By the winding-up Act of 1851 compulsory contributions
ceased; but those who chose to continue to subscribe
voluntarily might do so. It is hardly to be wondered
at that the merchant seamen lost confidence in
the paternal protection of the Board of Trade. A few
thousand pounds were left from the compulsory contributions,
and when this came to be inquired for, nobody
knew anything about it. It had somehow slipped out
of the estimates, and nobody could tell what had become
of it.</p>

<p>That is what past governments have done for poor
mercantile Jack.</p>

<p>What has the great British public done for him? Not
so very much after all. The truth is, that the sailor, who
has always been spoken of as "so dreadfully improvident,"
has been practically regarded as being most self-helpful.
All the time that we have been shaking our
solemn heads, and lifting up our hands at the improvidence,
the folly, and the extravagance of these frequently
underpaid and sometimes overworked men, we have
made even the help that we were willing to extend to
them in their deeper necessities partially dependent on
their own constant and regular subscription to the same
end.</p>

<p>Poor improvident Jack!&mdash;poor thoughtless, incorrigible
fellow!&mdash;it was necessary for the Government of his country
to look after him, in order to protect him against his
own want of forethought, and the result has been to run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
the ship into shoal water, and go hopelessly to wreck
without so much as salvage money.</p>

<p>Jack ashore! Don't we all still look at the sailor in the
light of the evil war-times, when the king's men were said
to draw pocketsful of prize-money and to spend it in low
debauchery or wild wanton folly? Even now we repeat
the stories of frying watches along with beefsteaks
and onions, or eating bank-note sandwiches. Nay, to
this day in the fo'c's'le of merchant vessels some of the

<p class="nodent">There's a world of meaning in that grim suggestive summary;
but, thank God! it has less meaning now than it
once had. Until quite lately, sailors of merchant ships
could be kept for days waiting to be paid, and, sickened
with lingering for long weary hours about the office of
the broker or agent who withheld their money, fell into
the hands of the harpies who were, and still are constantly
on the look-out to plunder them. Men with all
the pure natural longing for home and reunion with those
near and dear to them, were compelled to loiter about
the foul neighbourhood of the dock where their ship discharged
its cargo, lodging in some low haunt with evil
company, and liable to every temptation that is rife in
such places, till too often so large a portion of their
hardly-earned wages had been forestalled, that in a
dreary and desperate madness of dissipation they were
tempted to fling away the small balance remaining to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
them, and to awake to reason only when, naked and
nearly destitute, they were compelled to go to sea again,
with a slender stock of clothes, and a week's board and
lodging paid for with advance notes.</p>

<p>From long confinement and monotony on shipboard,
the sailor even now comes to a sense of temporary freedom,
giddy with the unaccustomed sense of solid ground
and the wild toss and uproar of the ocean of life in a
great city. What are still the influences which in many
seaports await him directly his foot touches the shore,
and sometimes even before he has come over the vessel's
side? With a boy's recklessness, a man's passions, and
the unwonted excitement of possessing money and boundless
opportunities for spending it, a shoal of landsharks are
lying ready to batten on him. The tout, the crimp, and
all the wretches, male and female, who look upon him as
their prey, will never leave him from the time when they
watch him roll wonderingly on to the landing-stage, till
that desperate minute when he flings his last handful of
small change across the tavern counter, and calls for its
worth in drink, since "money is no use at sea."</p>

<p>This was far more frequently the termination of mercantile
Jack's spell ashore, before the new regulations as
to prompt payment of seamen's wages came into force.
At that time you had only to take a morning walk across
Tower Hill, where the bluff lay figure at the outfitter's
door stands for Jack in full feather, and thence to America
Square, or the neighbourhood of the Minories and Rosemary
Lane, to see dozens of poor fellows lounging listlessly
about the doors of pay-agents, waiting day after
day at the street-corners, with an occasional visit to the
public-house, and the perpetual consumption of "hard"
tobacco. It was easy afterwards to follow Jack to Ratcliffe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Rotherhithe, Shadwell, and the neighbourhood,
where his "friends" lay in wait for him to spend the evening;
in the tap-rooms of waterside taverns, where he sat
hopelessly drinking and smoking during a hot summer's
afternoon; to frowsy, low-browed shops of cheap
clothiers, to hot, stifling dancing-rooms, to skittle-alleys
behind gin-shop bars, where a sudden brawl would call
out knives, and the use of a "slung-shot" as a weapon
would make a case of manslaughter for the coroner; to
very minor theatres, where he could see absurd caricatures
of himself in the stage sailors, dancing hornpipes unknown
at sea; to the dreadful dens of Bluegate Fields and Tiger
Bay&mdash;to any or all of these places you might have followed
Jack; and may even yet follow his fellows who
have not yet been redeemed from the evil ways of those
bad times, when there were no homes for sailors amidst
the bewildering vice and misery of maritime London, and
other seaport towns of this great mercantile island.</p>

<p>It so happened that I made my first intimate acquaintance
with the one real, publicly representative "Sailors'
Home" in Well Street, near the London Docks, after
having seen Jack under several of the terrible conditions
just referred to, so that, with this painful knowledge of
him and his ways, it was with a kind of delighted surprise
that I suddenly walked into the great entrance-hall
of the institution, where he and his fellows were sitting
on the benches by the wall with the serious, contemplative,
almost solemn air which is (in my experience)
the common expression of sailors ashore, and during
ordinary leisure hours. There they were, a good ship's
crew of them altogether, sitting, as I have already said,
in true sailor fashion&mdash;stooping forward, wrists on knees,
lolling on sea-chests and clothes-bags, taking short fore-and-aft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
walks of six steps and a turn in company with
some old messmate, smoking, growling, chatting, and
generally enjoying their liberty; not without an eye, now
and then, to the smart officer who had come in to see
whether he could pick up a brisk hand or two for the
mail service.</p>

<p>This was some five or six years ago, and it is a happy
result of the plan on which the Home was first established
(which was intended ultimately to make the institution
self-supporting, if the cost of building were
defrayed) that the whole scheme has been so enlarged
since that time, that anybody who would see what our
mercantile seamen are like, may now go and see them,
in a largely increasing community, in this great institution.
So many come and go and reappear at intervals
represented by the length of their voyages, that
10,120 officers and men had partaken of its inestimable
benefits during the year from the first of May, 1872, to
the end of April, 1873.</p>

<p>But the institution itself was founded in earnest faith,
and built with the labour that is consecrated by prayer.
Both to the Home and to its companion institution,
the Refuge for Destitute Seamen&mdash;we will pay a visit on
our next meeting.</p>

<h2><i>WITH THEM WHO WERE READY TO PERISH.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_O.jpg" width="100" height="103" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span>
the 28th of February, 1828, a very terrible
calamity happened in the place known as Wellclose
Square, Whitechapel. A new theatre
called the Brunswick, had been erected there
on the site of a former building, known as the Old Royalty.
It had been completed in seven months, and three days
afterwards, during a rehearsal, the whole structure gave
way and fell with a crash, burying ten persons amidst
the ruins, and fearfully injuring several others. Such a
catastrophe was very awful, and the people of the
neighbourhood looked with an almost solemn curiosity at
the wreck of an edifice in which they themselves might
have met with death suddenly.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, they began to regard the heap of
ruins with surprise, for early one morning there appeared
two officers of the Royal Navy, surrounded by a gang of
labourers with picks and shovels, and before these men
(some of whom were Irish Roman Catholic) began to
work they listened attentively while one of the officers
offered up an earnest prayer to God for a blessing on the
results of the labour they were about to undertake.
Morning after morning their labour was thus sanctified,
and evening after evening it was celebrated by the voice
of thanksgiving, till at length the ground was cleared, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
on the 10th of June, 1830, the first stone of a new building
was laid. The building was to be a Home for Sailors,
and as a necessary adjunct to the Home, it was intended
to establish a Destitute Sailors' Asylum.</p>

<p>The two naval officers were Captain (now Admiral)
George C. Gambier, and Captain Robert James Elliot,
now gone to his rest, who with Lieutenant Robert Justice
afterwards Captain, and now with his old comrade, in the
heavenly haven, had been seeking how to ameliorate the
condition of seamen, numbers of whom were to be seen
homeless, miserable, and frequently half naked and destitute,
in that foul and wretched neighbourhood about
the Docks and beyond Tower Hill.</p>

<p>The task was a difficult one, and might have daunted
less brave and hopeful men, for it was intended to demolish
the piratical haunts where the enemies of the sailor lay in
wait for his destruction; where crimps and thieves and
the keepers of infamous dens held their besotted victims
in bondage, while they battened on the wages that had been
earned during months of privation and arduous toil.</p>

<p>It was necessary, therefore, first to provide a decent
and comfortable lodging-house for the reception of sailors
coming into port,&mdash;a place where they might safely deposit
their clothes and their wages, and where they could "look
out for another ship" without the evil intervention of crimps
or pretended agents. It was a part of the intended plan
also to establish a savings bank, for securing any portion
of their wages which they chose to lay by, or for safely
transmitting such sums as they might wish to send to their
relations. In short, the design was to provide a home
for the homeless, and hold out helping hands to those
who were ready to perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
Those ruins of the theatre stood on the very spot for
such an establishment, and the two captains, Gambier and
Elliott, began by buying the ground and the wreck that
stood upon it, not by asking for public subscriptions, but
mostly with their own money, to which was added a few
contributions from any of their friends who desired to
join in the good work.</p>

<p>It is impossible to use more earnest or touching words
than those in which the late Rear-Admiral Sir W. E.
Parry spoke of the labours of his friend and fellow-supporter
of the Sailors' Home, in an address to British
seamen at Southampton, in 1853. "And now," he said,
"let me just add that, from the first moment in which
Captain Elliot stood among the ruins of the Brunswick
Theatre, till it pleased God to deprive him of bodily and
mental energy, did that self-denying Christian man
devote all his powers, his talents, his influence, and his
money, to this his darling object of protecting and providing
for the comfort of sailors. Connected with a
noble family, and entitled by birth, education, and
station, to all the advantages which the most exalted
society could give hm, he willingly relinquished all, took
up his abode in a humble lodging, surrounded by gin-shops,
near the 'Home:' denied himself most of the
comforts, it may almost be said some of the necessaries
of life, in order the more effectually to carry out his
benevolent design; and for eighteen years of self-denial
and devotion, made it the business of his life to superintend
this institution."</p>

<p>For the noble officer lived to see the building for which
he had wrought and prayed, complete and successful. In
1835 300 sailors could be received and welcomed there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
The piratical lairs began to empty of some of those who
had been shown a way of escape, and the good work
went on. In the adjoining Seamen's Church the congregation
was largely augmented by the boarders from
the Sailors' Home, while the Honorary Chaplain and the
Missionary attached officially to the institution, became
not only parson and preacher, but friendly adviser and
instructor, ready to speak, to hear, and to forbear. The
addition of a book depository, where various useful publications
may be purchased, and Bibles are sold at the
lowest possible prices, and in various languages, was a
valuable auxiliary to moral and religious instruction, and
at once increased the home-like influences of the place.</p>

<p>The institution having gone on thus prosperously,
under the direction of a goodly number of officers and
gentlemen, added to its possessions by acquiring other
plots of freehold ground, extending backward to Dock
Street; and in 1863 Lord Palmerston laid the stone of
an entirely new block of building, which was inaugurated
by the Prince of Wales in 1865, since which time 502
boarders can be received, each being provided with his
separate cabin.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the institution in 1835 it has
received 246,855 seamen of various countries and from
all parts of the world. Of these 72,234 have been old or
returned boarders, and most of them have conducted their
money transactions through the "Home," and have
made good use of the savings-bank.</p>

<p>There are 270 inmates under that protecting roof as I
step into the large entrance hall in Well Street to-day;
and the two hundred and seventy-first has just gone to
look after his kit and sea-chests, which have been carefully
conveyed from the Docks by one of the carmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
belonging to the institution, who has "The Sailors' Home,
Well Street," worked in red worsted on his shirt, and
painted on the side of the van from which he has just
alighted.</p>

<p>It is evident that our friend No. 271 has been here
before, for he knows exactly where to present himself in
order to deposit some of his more portable property with
the cashier or the superintendent. He scarcely looks
like a man who will want an advance of money, for he is
a smart, alert, bright-eyed fellow, with a quiet air of self-respect
about him which seems to indicate an account in
the savings-bank; but should he be "hard-up," he can
ask for and receive a loan not exceeding twenty shillings
directly his chest is deposited in his cabin. Just now the
chest itself, together with its superincumbent bundle,
stands against the wall along with some other incoming
or outgoing boxes, more than one of which are associated
with brand new cages for parrots, and some odd-shaped
cases evidently containing sextants or other nautical instruments.
There is a whole ship's crew, and a smart one
too, in the hall to-day; while a small contingent occupies
the clothing department, where one or two shrewd North-countrymen
are being fitted each with a "new rig,"
knowing well enough that they will be better served there
than at any of the cheap outfitters (or the dear ones
either) in the neighbourhood. Fine blue broadcloth,
pilots, tweeds, rough weather, and petershams are here
to choose from "to measure," as well as a wonderful collection
of hats, caps, underclothing, hosiery, neckties,
boots, and shoes so unlike the clumsy specimens that
swing along with the tin pots and oilskins in some of
the little low-browed shops about the district, that I
at once discover the reason for the smartness and general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
neatly-fitted look of most of the men and lads now pacing
up and down, talking and smoking. It is quiet talk
for the most part, even when half a dozen of the inmates
adjourn to the refreshment-room, where they can obtain
a glass of good sound beer (though there is a much more
general appreciation of coffee) and sit down comfortably
at a table like that at which two serious mates are
already discussing some knotty point, which will probably
last till tea-time.</p>

<p>Tea-time? There is the half-past five o'clock signal
gong going now, and light swift steps are to be heard
running up the stairs into the large dining-hall, where the
two hundred and seventy-one, or as many of them as are
at home, sit down like fellows who know their business
and mean to do it. It is a pleasant business enough,
and one soon despatched; for there are so many big teapots,
that each table is amply provided by the alert
attendants, who dispense bread-and-butter, watercresses,
salads, and savoury bloaters and slices of ham and tongue,
the latter having been already served by a carver who is
equal to the occasion. It is astonishing how quickly the
meal is over when its substantial quality is taken into
account; but there is no lack of waiters, the number of
attendants in the building being sixty-five, some of whom,
of course, belong to the dormitories and to other departments.</p>

<p>The meals here are, of course, served with the utmost
regularity, and without limit to quantity. Breakfast,
with cold meat, fish, bacon, and general "relishes," at
eight in the morning; dinner at one: consisting of soup,
roast and boiled meats, ample supplies of vegetables,
occasional fish, stupendous fruit-pies and puddings, and
a good allowance of beer. After tea comes a substantial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
snack for supper, at nine o'clock, and the doors of the institution
are kept open to half-past eleven at night; those
who wish to remain out later being required to obtain a
pass from the superintendent.</p>

<p>Of course it is requested that the boarders come
in to meals as punctually as possible; but those
who cannot conveniently be present at the regular
time, can have any meal supplied to them on application.
Indeed, two or three belated ones are arriving
now, as we go to the end of the long and lofty
refectory to look at the crest of the late Admiral Sir
William Bowles, K.C.B., which, supported by flags, is
painted upon the wall, as a memorial of a gallant officer
and a good friend to this institution and to all sailors.</p>

<p>Leaving the dining-hall, we notice a smaller room, set
apart for masters and mates who may desire to have their
meals served here; and on the same extensive storey is
a large and comfortable reading-room well supplied with
periodicals, and containing a capital library consisting of
entertaining and instructive books.</p>

<p>The board-room is close by, and is of the size
and shape to make an excellent mission-room, where
week-night services and meetings of a religious character
are held, and well attended by men who, having seen the
wonders of the Lord upon the great deep, join in His
reasonable service when they are at home and at rest.
This vast floor also contains two dormitories: but
most of the sleeping cabins are in the second and third
floors.</p>

<p>There are few sights in London more remarkable than
these berths, which are, in fact, separate cabins, each
closed by its own door, and containing bed, wash-stand,
chair, looking-glass, towels, and ample space for the seachest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
and personal belongings of the occupant. The
cabins extend round a large area rising to a great height,
and surrounded above by a light gallery reached by an
outer staircase, round which are another series of berths
exactly resembling the lower ones; so that there are, in
fact, double, and in one or two dormitories treble tiers of
cabins, and the upper ones may be entered without disturbing
the inmates of those below. One of the three-decker
areas is of vast size, and, standing in the upper
gallery and looking upward to the lofty roof, and then
downward to the clear, wide, open space between the lower
rooms, the visitor is struck by the admirable provision
both for light and ventilation; the former being secured
at night by means of properly distributed gas jets, which
are of course under the care of the night attendants, who
are on watch in each dormitory, and may be summoned
at once in case of illness or accident.</p>

<p>Not only is there provision against fire by a length of
fire-hose attached to hydrants on each storey, but the
water supply to lavatories and for other purposes is
secured by a cistern holding 4,000 gallons at the top of the
building; so that there is complete circulation throughout
the various parts of the building.</p>

<p>It is time that we paid a visit to the basement of this
great institution, however; for, in more senses than one,
it may be said to be at the foundation of the arrangements.
Yes, even with respect to the amusements provided
for the inmates&mdash;for while chess, draughts and backgammon
are to be found in the library and reading-room,
and billiards and bagatelle hold their own on the great
landings of the first storey, we have down here a skittle-alley
of a character so remarkable, that some of us who
have read Washington Irving think of the reverberations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
the giants' pastime in the mountains, while we wonder
where sailors can first have acquired a taste for this particular
amusement. It is a good and healthy one, however,
and is wisely provided, since it adds one more
efficient inducement to the men to take their pleasure
among their true friends instead of seeking it amidst the
evil influences of a filthy tavern, or in the garish heat of
some vile Ratcliff Highway bowling-alley, where men are
maddened with drugged drink, and greeted with foul
imprecations by the harpies who seek to rob and cheat
them.</p>

<p>There is much to see in this basement, and to begin
with here is No. two hundred and seventy-one sending his
chest up by the great luggage-lift to the second floor,
where he will find it presently in his cabin. We cannot
stay to speak to him, however, for we are on the very
verge of the kitchen, to which we are, as it were, led by
the nose; for wafted thence comes an appetising perfume
of new bread just taken from one of the great ovens devoted
to the daily baking. There are lingering odours also of today's
dinner, though the meat ovens and the great boilers
and hot plates are clean and ready for the morrow. The
pantry door, too, is open, and there are toothsome varieties
of "plain-eating" therein, while the storerooms savour of
mingled comforts, to which the gales of Araby the blest
offer no parallel, and the butcher's shop has a calm and
concentrated sense of meatiness which is suggestive to a
robust appetite not already satiated with a chunk from
one of a whole squadron of soft, new currant-cakes. After
a peep at the large and busy laundry with its peculiar
moist atmosphere, the coal and beer cellars, the pumping
machinery and boiler-room may be passed by, and little
curiosity is excited by this long and convenient apartment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
where hot and cold baths are prepared to order at
a merely nominal charge. There is a door close by, however,
where we stop instinctively, for there is a cheerful
light inside, and a sound of easy and yet interrupted conversation
which can belong to only one department of
society. There can be no mistake about it&mdash;a veritable
barber's shop, and a gentleman with a preternaturally
clean chin complacently surveying himself in a looking-glass
of limited dimensions, while another waits to be
operated upon by the skilled practitioner who carries in
his face the suggestion of a whole ropery of "tough yarns,"
and was&mdash;or am I mistaken&mdash;tonsor to the <i>Victory</i> or to
some ship of war equally famous when the British seaman
shaved close and often, and pigtails had hardly gone out
of fashion. There is no time for testing the great artist's
skill this evening, though I could almost sacrifice a well-grown
beard to hear some rare old fo'c's'le story. But
no story could be more wonderful than the plain truth
that for all the generous provision in this excellent institution
the rescued sailor brought within its wholesome
influence pays but fifteen shillings a week. Yes, men and
apprentices, fifteen shillings; and officers, eighteen and
sixpence.</p>

<p>The evening lowers over the outer world of Mint Street
and Leman Street, and the great blank void of the Tower
ditch is full of shadow. Standing again in the large entrance
hall, which reminds one more of shipboard, now
that the lights are dotted about it, leaving it still a little
dim, I hear the trickling of a drinking-fountain, and associated
with its fresh plash hear as pleasant a story as
any yarn that ever the barber himself could have spun
for my delight.</p>

<p>The fountain, which is of polished Aberdeen granite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
was opened last November in proper style, a platform
being erected, and the chair being taken by the Secretary
to the "Metropolitan Drinking Fountains Association,"
supported by several ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Lee
made an appropriate speech, and called attention to the
gift, and pointed to the inscription; and it was quite an
emphatic little observance for the inmates who had
gathered in the hall on the occasion. And well it might
be, for the fountain bears this modest inscription:&mdash;"The
gift of William McNeil, Seaman, in appreciation of the
great benefits he has derived on the various occasions
during which he has made the Institution his <i>Home</i>, for
upwards of 25 years."</p>

<p>I think very little more need be said for the Sailors'
Home than is indicated by this plain, earnest testimony
to its worth. Yet it is necessary to say one more word.
This Sailors' Home is in a way self-supporting, and at
present seeks only the kindly interest of the public in case
it should ever need another response to an appeal for extending
its sphere of usefulness. Not a farthing of profit
is permitted to any individual engaged in it, and even
fees to servants are prohibited, though the crimps and touts
outside endeavour to bribe them sometimes, to induce
sailors to go to the common lodging-houses, where land-rats
seek their prey. All the profits, if there are any at all,
are placed to a reserve fund for repairs, improvements, or
extensions. At any rate, no public appeals are being made
just now.</p>

<p>But there is another institution next door&mdash;another
branch of the stem which has grown so sturdily from the
seed planted by the good captain&mdash;the Destitute Sailors'
Asylum. That is a place full of interest, though there is
nothing to see there. Nothing but a clean yard, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
means for washing and cleansing, and a purifying oven
for removing possible infection from clothes, and a great
bare room, just comfortably warmed in winter, and hung
with rows of hammocks, like the 'tween-decks of a ship.</p>

<p>That is all; but in those hammocks, sometimes, poor
starved and destitute sailors go to sleep, after they have
been fed with soup and warmed and comforted; and in
the morning, when they turn out, they are fed again with
cocoa and bread, and if they are naked they are clothed.
There are not very many applicants, for, strange as it may
appear, since sailors' homes have come in fashion there
are but few destitute seamen; but there <i>need be no unrelieved
destitute sailors at all in London</i>, for anybody can
send such a one to the Asylum in Well Street, London
Docks, and he will be admitted. Here then, is an institution
that may claim support.</p>

<h2><i>CASTING BREAD UPON THE WATERS.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_O.jpg" width="100" height="103" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">One</span>
of the old Saxon commentators on the
Holy Scriptures, in referring to the passage,
"Cast thy bread upon the waters, and it shall
be found after many days," ventures to suggest
as a meaning&mdash;"Give succour to poor and afflicted
seamen." Whatever may be the conclusions of critical
Biblical expositors, there can be no doubt that the pious
annotator was right in a true&mdash;that is, in a spiritual interpretation
of the text.</p>

<p>Should it be necessary to appeal twice to the English
nation&mdash;which has, as it were a savour of sea-salt in its
very blood&mdash;to hold out a helping hand for those who,
having struggled to keep our dominion by carrying the flag
of British commerce all round the world, are themselves
flung ashore, weak, old, and helpless, dependent on the
goodwill of their countrymen to take them into some
quiet harbour, where they may, as it were be laid up in
ordinary and undergo some sort of repairs, even though
they should never again be able to go a voyage? It is
with feelings of something like regret that an average
Englishman sees the old hull of a sea-going boat lie
neglected and uncared for on the beach. Not without a
pang can we witness the breaking-up of some stout old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
ship no longer seaworthy. Yet, unhappily, we have
hitherto given scant attention to the needs of those old
and infirm seamen, who having for many years contributed
out of their wages to the funds of the Naval
Hospital at Greenwich, and having been again mulcted
of some subscriptions which were to have been specially
devoted to found an asylum for themselves, are left with
little to look forward to but the workhouse ward when,
crippled, sick, or feeble with age, they could no longer
tread the deck or crack a biscuit.</p>

<p>It is true that there are now hospitals or sick-asylums
in connection with some of the sailors' homes at our seaports,
and to the general hospitals any sailor can be
admitted if he should be able to procure a letter from
a governor. The 'tween-decks of the <i>Dreadnought</i> no
longer form the sole hospital for invalided merchant
seamen in the Port of London; but even reckoning all
that has been done for sailors, and fresh from a visit to
that great building where three hundred hale and hearty
seamen of the great mercantile navy find a home, we are
left to wonder that so little has been accomplished for
those old tars who, having lived for threescore years or
more, going to and fro upon the great deep, can find no
certain anchorage, except within the walls of some union
where they may at last succeed in claiming a settlement.
Surely there is no figure which occupies a more prominent
place in English history than that of the sailor&mdash;not
the man-o'-war's man only&mdash;but the merchant seaman,
the descendant of those followers of the great old
navigators who were called "merchant adventurers," and
who practically founded for Great Britain new empires
beyond the sea. In the poetry, the songs, the literature,
the political records, the social chronicles, the domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
narratives of England, the sailor holds a place, and even
at our holiday seasons, when our children cluster on the
shingly shore or the far-stretching brown sands of the
coast, we find still that we belong to a nation of which
the sailor long stood as the chosen representative. Nay,
in the midst of the life of a great city we cannot fail to
be reminded of the daring and the enterprise which has
helped to make London what it is.</p>

<p>The poet, who, standing on the bridge at midnight,
and listening to the chime of the hour, found his imagination
occupied with serious images and his memory with
solemn recollections, would have been no less moved to
profound contemplation had he been a temporary occupant
of one of the great structures that span the silent
highway of the Thames. There is something in the
flow of a broad and rapid stream which has a peculiar
association with thoughts of the struggle and toil of
human life, and as we look on the ever-moving tide, we
ask ourselves what have we done for the brave old toil-worn
men who have seen the wonders of the great
deep for so many years, and have brought so much to
us that we can scarcely speak of food or drink without
some reminder of their toilsome lives and long voyages?
Well, a little has been done,&mdash;very little when we reflect
how much yet remains to be accomplished; and yet
much, regarded as a fair opportunity for doing a great
deal more. I have already recounted some part of the
sad story of what a provident Government did when it
thought to undertake the affairs of poor improvident
Jack. How it collected his money, and neglected to give
him the benefit of the enforced subscription; how it
administered and laid claim to his poor little effects and
arrears of pay, if he died abroad and nobody came forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
to establish a right to them; how it demanded
additional contributions from his monthly wages, in order
to show him how to establish a relief fund; and how
somehow the scheme went "by the board" (of Trade),
and the balance of the money was lost in the gulf of the
estimates.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1860 it became clear to a number of
leading merchants, shipowners, and officers of the mercantile
marine that nothing was to be looked for from
the State when the subject of making an effort to provide
for aged and infirm sailors was again urgently
brought forward; but it was determined to make a definite
movement, and "The Shipwrecked Mariners'
Society," which had then 40,000 officers and seamen
among its subscribers, was appealed to as a body having
the power to form the required association.</p>

<p>It was not till 1867, however, that the actual work of
providing an asylum for old sailors was commenced.
The society had then put down the sum of £5,000 as a
good beginning, a committee had been appointed, of
which the late honoured Paymaster Francis Lean was
the indefatigable honorary secretary, and Captain Thomas
Tribe the secretary, whilst the list of patrons, presidents,
vice-presidents, and supporters included many eminent
noblemen and gentlemen who took a true interest in the
undertaking.</p>

<p>Several public meetings were held, and "a Pension and
Widows' Fund" was first established. Then the committee
began to look about them for a suitable house in
which to begin their real business, and had their attention
directed to a large building at that time for sale, situated
on the breezy height above Erith, and formerly well
known as the residence of Sir Culling Eardley, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
named it Belvidere. The property, including twenty-three
acres of surrounding land, cost £12,148, and
£5,000 having already been subscribed, the balance of
£7,148 was borrowed at five per cent. interest. Not till
the 5th of May, 1866, however, was the institution inaugurated
and handed over to a committee of management.</p>

<p>It is admirably suggestive of its present occupation,
this fine roomy old mansion, standing on the sheltered
side, but near the top, of the lofty eminence, whence
such a magnificent view may be obtained, not only of the
surrounding country, but of the mighty river where it
widens and rushes towards the sea. Here on the broad
sloping green, where the tall flagstaff with its rigging
supports the Union Jack, the old fellows stroll in the sun
or look out with a knowing weather-eye towards the
shipping going down stream, or sit to smoke and gossip
on the bench beneath their spreading tree opposite the
great cedar, while the cow of the institution chews the
cud with a serious look, as though it had someway
caught the thoughtful expression that characterises
"turning a quid." A hundred infirm sailors, each of
whom is more than sixty years old, are serenely at their
moorings in that spacious square-built house, where the
long wards are divided into cabins, each with its neat furniture,
and many of them ornamented with the curious
knick-knacks, and strange waifs and strays of former
voyages which sailors like to have about them. There is
of course a sick-ward, where those who are permanently
disabled, or are suffering from illness, receive medical
attention and a special diet; but the majority of the inmates
are comparatively hearty still, though they are
disabled, and can no longer "hand reef and steer."</p>

<p>There are a hundred inmates in this admirable asylum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
and ninety pensioners who are with their friends at the
various outports of the kingdom, each receiving a pension
of £1 a month, called the "Mariners' National
Pension Fund," the working management of which, with
the "Widows' Annuity Fund," is made over to the
"Shipwrecked Mariners' Society."</p>

<p>A hundred and ninety worn-out and disabled seamen
now provided for or assisted, and a total of above 300
relieved since the opening of the institution. A good and
noble work truly. But can it be called by so great a name
as <i>National</i>, when we know how large a number of old
sailors are yet homeless, and that at the last election
there were 153 candidates who could not be assisted because
of the want of funds to relieve their distress?
Looking at the number of men (2,000 to 5,000) lost at
sea or by shipwreck every year, and at the inquiry which
has been made, through the efforts of Mr. Plimsoll and
others, with respect to the conditions under which the
service of the mercantile marine of this country is carried
on, is it not a reproach to us that during the nineteen
years since this institution was founded, so little has been
done? Year by year it has been hoped that the Board
of Trade would relinquish its claim to take possession of
the effects of sailors dying abroad, and would transfer
the £1,200 a year represented by this property to the
funds of the society, but hitherto the committee have
waited in vain. The donations from all sources are comparatively
few; and though the annual subscriptions are
numerous, they are rapidly absorbed.</p>

<p>Many masters, mates, seamen, engineers and firemen
pay to this institution a subscription of five shillings a
year, for which they have a vote at each annual election;
or any such subscriber may leave his votes to accumulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
for his own benefit when he shall have reached the
age of sixty years, and becomes a candidate for admission.</p>

<p>One-fifth of the candidates admitted are nominated by
the committee on the ground of their necessities or
special claims to the benefit of the charity, while general
subscribers or donors have privileges of election according
to the amount contributed. Perhaps one of the
most touching records of the subscription list is, that not
only did the cadets of the mercantile training-ship
<i>Worcester</i> contribute something like £100 in one official
year, but that the little fellows on board the union
training-ship <i>Goliath</i> lying off Grays, have joined their
officers and their commander, Captain Bourchier, to
send offerings to the aid of the ancient mariners, of
whom they are the very latest representatives. On many
a good ship these small collections are made for the
same object, and at the Sailors' Home in Well Street
there is a box for stray contributions; but much more
has yet to be done. Perhaps it is far to go to see this
great house on the hill, but most of us have caught a
glimpse of its tall towers and its flagstaff in our excursions
down the silent highway of London's river, and it
might be well to think how little effort is required to give
to each cabin its inmate, and to fill the dining-room with
tables, each with its "mess" of six or eight old salts,
who are ready to greet you heartily if you pay them a
visit, and to salute you with a grave seamanlike respect.
Would you like to know how this rare old crew lives in
the big house under the lee of the wind-blown hill? To
begin with, the men who are not invalids turn out at
eight in winter and half-past seven in summer, and after
making beds and having a good wash, go down to prayers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
and breakfast at nine or half-past eight, breakfast consisting
of coffee or cocoa and bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the ward-men, who are appointed in rotation,
go to clean wards and make all tidy, each inmate
being, however, responsible for the neatness of his own
cabin, in which nobody is allowed to drive nails in bulkheads
or walls, and no cutting or carving of woodwork is
permitted. The men not for the time employed in tidying
up or airing bedding, &amp;c., can, if they choose, go into
the industrial ward, where they can work at several occupations
for their own profit, as they are only charged
for cost of materials. Dinner is served in the several
messes by the appointed messmen at one o'clock, and
consists on Sundays of roast beef, vegetables, and plum-pudding,
and on week-days of roast or boiled meat, soup,
vegetables, with one day a week salt fish, onions, potatoes,
and plain suet-pudding, and in summer an occasional
salad. A pint of beer is allowed for each man.
The afternoon may be devoted either to work, or to recreation
in the reading and smoking rooms, or in the
grounds. Tea and bread-and-butter are served at half-past
five in summer and at six in winter, and there is
often a supper of bread-and-cheese and watercresses or
radishes. The evening is devoted to recreation, and at
half-past nine in winter, and ten in summer, after prayers,
lights are put out, and every one retires for the night.</p>

<p>None of the inmates are expected to work in the industrial
wards, and of course there are various servants and
attendants, all of whom are chosen by preference from
the families of sailors, or have themselves been at sea.
The whole place is kept so orderly, and everything is so
ship-shape, that there is neither waste nor confusion,
and yet every man there is at liberty to go in and out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
when he pleases, on condition of being in at meal-times,
and at the time for evening prayers, any one desiring to
remain away being required to ask permission of the
manager. It must be mentioned, too, that there is an
allowance of ninepence a week spending money for each
inmate.</p>

<p>The men are comfortably clothed, in a decent sailorly
fashion, and many of the old fellows have still the bright,
alert, active look that belongs to the "smart hands,"
among whom some of them were reckoned nearly half
a century ago. The most ancient of these mariners
at the time of my first visit was ninety-two years old,
and it so happened that I saw him on his birthday.
He came up the broad flight of stairs to speak to me,
with a foot that had not lost all its lightness, while the
eye that was left to him (he had lost one by accident
twenty years before) was as bright and open as a sailor's
should be. This is a long time ago, and William Coverdale
(that was his name) has probably gone to his rest.
Significantly enough, at the time of my latest visit,
the oldest representative of the last muster-roll was
James Nelson, a master mariner of Downpatrick, eighty-five
years of age; while bo's'n Blanchard is eighty-one;
able seaman John Hall, eighty; William Terry
(A. B.), eighty-two, and masters, mates, quartermasters,
cooks, and stewards, ranged over seventy. With many
of them this is the incurable disability that keeps
them ashore; the sort of complaint which is common to
sailors and landsmen alike if they live long enough&mdash;that
of old age. It will come one day, let us hope, to the
young Prince, whom we may regard as the Royal representative
of the English liking for the sea. For the
asylum for old and infirm sailors at Greenhithe has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
been called Belvidere for some years now. Prince Alfred
went to look at it one day, and asked leave to become its
patron, since which it has been called "The Royal Alfred
Aged Merchant Seamen's Institution"&mdash;rather a long
name, but then it ought to mean so much.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></div>

<h2><i>WITH THE FEEBLE AND FAINT-HEARTED.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_I.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Is</span>
there any condition wherein we feel greater
need of human help and true loving sympathy
than in the slow, feeble creeping from
sickness to complete convalescence, when the
pulse of life beats low, and the failing foot yet lacks
power to step across that dim barrier between health and
sickness&mdash;not far from the valley of the shadow of death?</p>

<p>In the bright, glowing summer-tide, when the sun
warms bloodless creatures into renewed life, our English
sea-coast abounds with visitors, among whom near and
dear friends, parents, children, slowly and painfully winning
their way back to health and strength are the objects
of peculiar care. In all our large towns people who
have money to spend are, at least, beginning to make up
their minds where they shall take their autumn holiday;&mdash;in
many quiet health-resorts wealthy invalids, and
some who are not wealthy, have already passed the early
spring and summer;&mdash;at a score of pleasant watering-places,
where the cool sparkling waves break upon the
"ribbed sea-sand," troops of children are already browning
in the sun, scores of hearts feel a throb of grateful
joy as the glow of health begins to touch cheeks lately
pale, and dull eyes brighten under the clear blue sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
Thousands upon thousands are then on their way to
that great restorer, the sea, if it be only for a few
hours by excursion train. England might seem to have
gathered all its children at its borders, and very soon we
hear how empty London is, while a new excuse for a
holiday will be that there is "nothing doing" and "nobody
is in town." And yet throughout the busy streets
a throng continues to hurry onward in restless activity.
Only well-accustomed observers could see any considerable
difference in the great thoroughfares of London.
Shops and factories look busy enough, and if nothing is
doing, there is a mighty pretence of work, while the nobodies
are a formidable portion of the population when
regarded in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Early in August the census of our large towns still
further diminishes. Prosperous tradesmen, noting the
decrease of customers, begin to prepare to take part in
the general exodus. "Gentlefolks" have concluded bargains
for furnished houses on the coast and put their
dining and drawing-rooms into brown holland. In West-End
streets and squares the front blinds are drawn, and
all inquiries are answered from the areas, where charwomen
supplement the duties of servants on board
wages. "London is empty," the newspapers say, and in
every large town in the kingdom the great outgoing
leaves whole districts comparatively untenanted. Yet
what a vast population remains; what a great army of toiling
men and women who go about their daily work, and
keep up the unceasing buzz of the industrial hive. What
troops of children, who, except for Sunday-school treats,
would scarcely spend a day amidst green fields, or learn
how to make a daisy-chain, or hear the soft summer wind
rustling the leaves of overhanging trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
It would perhaps astonish us if we could have set
down for us in plain figures how many men and women in
England have never seen the sea; how many people
have never spent a week away from home, or had a real
long holiday in all their lives. It may be happy for them
if they are not compelled by sudden sickness or accident,
to fall out of the ranks, and to leave the plough sticking
in the furrow. It is not all for pleasure and careless enjoyment
that the thousands of our wealthy brethren and
sisters go to the terraced houses, or handsomely appointed
mansions, which await them all round the English
shore. Into how many eyes tears must need
spring, when the prayers for all who are in sorrow, need,
or adversity are read in seaside churches on a summer's
Sunday. By what sick-beds, and couches set at windows
whence wistful eyes may look out upon the changeful
glory of wood and sea and sky, anxious hearts are
throbbing. What silent tears and low murmuring cries
on behalf of dear ones on whose pale cheeks the July
roses never more may bloom, mark the watches of the
silent night, when the waves sob wakefully upon the
beach. What thrills of hope and joy contend with obtrusive
fears as, the golden spears of dawn break through
the impenetrable slate-blue sky, and a touch of strength
and healing is seen to have left its mark upon a brow on
which the morning kiss is pressed with a keen throb
that is itself almost a pang.</p>

<p>The first faltering footsteps back to life after a long
illness or a severe shock, how they need careful guidance.
Let the stronger arm, the helping hand, the encouraging
eye be ready, or they may fail before the goal of safety
be reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
"All that is now wanted is strength, careful nursing,
plenty of nourishment, pure air&mdash;the seaside if possible,
and perhaps the south coast would be best." Welcome
tidings, even though they herald slow recovery, inch by
inch and day by day, while watchful patience measures
out the time by meat and drink, and the money that will
buy the means of comfort or of pleasure, becomes but
golden sand running through the hour-glass, which marks
each happy change.</p>

<p>Yes; but what of the poor and feeble, the faint-hearted
who, having neither oil nor wine, nor the twopence wherewith
to pay for lodging at the inn, must need lie there by
the way-side, if no hand is stretched out to help them?</p>

<p>While at those famous health-resorts, the names of
which are to be read at every railway station, and in the
advertisement sheets of every newspaper, hundreds and
thousands are coming back from weakness to strength,
there are hundreds and thousands still who are discharged
from our great metropolitan hospitals, to creep to rooms
in dim, close courts and alleys, where all the tending
care that can be given them must be snatched from the
hours of labour necessary to buy medicine and food.
How many a poor sorrowing soul has said with a sigh,
"Oh! if I could only send you to the sea-side. The
doctors all say fresh air's the great thing; but what's
the use? they say the same of pure milk and meat and
wine."</p>

<p>It may be the father who has met with an accident,
and cannot get over the shock of a surgical operation&mdash;or
rheumatic fever may have left mother, son, or
daughter in that terrible condition of utter prostration,
when it seems as though we were in momentary danger
of floating away into a fainting unconsciousness, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
not being oblivion, engages us in a struggle beyond our
waking powers.</p>

<p>Alas! in the great summer excursion to the coast
these poor fainting brethren and sisters are too seldom
remembered. Here and there a building is pointed out
as an infirmary, a sea-side hospital, or even as a retreat
for convalescents, but the latter institutions are so few,
and the best of them are so inadequately supported, that
they have never yet been able to prove by startling
figures the great benefits which they confer upon those
who are received within their walls.</p>

<p>One of the oldest of these truly beneficent Institutions,
"The Sea-side Convalescent Hospital at Seaford," has
just completed a new, plain, but commodious building,
not far from the still plainer House which has for many
years been the Home of its grateful patients. So let us
pay a visit to the old place just before its inmates are
transferred to more ample quarters, to provide for which
new subscriptions are needed, and fresh efforts are being
made. The visit will show us how, in an unpretentious
way, and without costly appliances, such a charitable
effort may be worthily maintained.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Seaford itself is an illustration of
declension from strength to weakness, and of the early
stages of recovery; for though it is one of the famous
Cinque Ports, it has for nearly 200 years been an unnoted
retreat.</p>

<p>But it is still a place of old, odd customs, such as the
election of the chief of the municipality at an assembly
of freemen at a certain gate-post in the town, to which
they are marshalled by an officer bearing a mace surmounted
with the arms of Queen Elizabeth. It is famous,
too, for Roman and other antiquities, and its queer
little church dedicated to St. Leonard, has some rare specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
of quaint carving and a peal of bells which are peculiarly
musical, while the sounding of the complines on a
still summer's night is good to hear. In fact, for a mere
cluster of houses forming an unpretentious and secluded
town, almost without shops to attract attention, with
scarcely the suspicion of a high street, and destitute of a
grand hotel, Seaford is remarkably interesting for its
legendary lore, as a good many people know, who have
discovered its greatest attraction, and take lodgings at
the dull little place, where even the martello tower is deserted.
The chief recommendation of the place, however,
is its healthfulness, and the grand air which blows off the
sea to the broad stretch of shingly beach, and the range
of cliff and down-land which stretches as far as Beachy
Head, and rises just outside the town into one or two bluffs,
about which the sea-gulls whirl and scream, as the evening
sun dips into the sparkling blue of the water. It is
just at the foot of the boldest of these ascents that we see
an old-fashioned mansion, once known as Corsica Hall,
but now more distinctly associated with the name of the
Convalescent Hospital, of which it has long been the
temporary home, the London offices of the charity being
at No. 8, Charing Cross, London.</p>

<p>The institution, which was founded in 1860, has for its
president the Archbishop of Canterbury, and for its
patronesses the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess
of Teck, and it has done its quiet work efficiently and well,
under difficulties which must have required staunch interest
on the part of its committee.</p>

<p>It is difficult at first to understand that the big many-roomed
house just by the spur of the cliff, and peeping
out to see over the shingle ridge, is in any sense a hospital;
but here is a convalescent who will give us a very fair idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
of the work that is being done; a tall fellow who is but
just recovering from acute rheumatism, and is now able
to go about slowly but with a cheery, hopeful look in his
face. Presently, as one comes near the front door, a lad,
who having come from a hospital where he has been
attended for fractured ancle, has been sent here to recover
strength, is hobbling across a poultry-yard, where
a grand company of black Spanish, Polish, Cochin China,
and other fowls are assembled to be fed, and beneath a
pent-house roof in this same yard, on a bench, which
would be well replaced by a more comfortable garden-seat
if the funds would allow, there is a sheltered and
comfortable corner for the afternoon indulgence of a whiff
of tobacco. Twenty-five men and twenty-four women
are all the inmates, besides attendants, for whom space
can be found; and an inspection of the airy and scrupulously
clean dormitories, or rather bedrooms, on each
side of the building, will show that all the accommodation
has been made available. It must be remembered,
however, that as the period of each inmate's stay is
but a month of twenty-eight days, fresh cases are constantly
admitted during all the summer months; so that
though as late as at the end of March only fourteen men
and six women were distributed in the wards, the average
number admitted during the last official year has been 511
(an increase of twenty-four over the year before), while the
total number of cases received since the opening of the institution
amounts to nearly 5,000.</p>

<p>There are evidences that in this old house, with its long
passages, and little supplementary stairs leading to the
bedrooms, economy has been studied, and yet all that
can be done to adapt the place to its purpose has been
effected. The sense of fresh air and cleanliness is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
first noticeable characteristic. There are no slovenly
corners; in sitting-rooms, corridors, or dormitories,
whether the latter be little rooms with only two or
three beds, or either of the large apartments, with
their wide bay-windows looking forth upon the sea.
Plainly and even sparely furnished, they have an appearance
of homelike comfort, and it is pleasant to
note that in the larger bright cheerful room devoted
to women patients there are evidences of feminine
taste and womanly belongings, even to the egg-cups
holding little posies of wild flowers and common garden
blooms that deck the broad mantelshelf in front of the
toilet glasses. The same home-like influences are to be
observed in other departments, and though this old country
house&mdash;of which the institution holds only a short
term as tenants&mdash;is not altogether suited for the purpose
to which it has been applied, the arrangements are not
without a certain pleasant departure from the too formal
and mechanical routine which is observed in some establishments
to have a peculiarly depressing influence on the
sick.</p>

<p>The kitchen is like that of some good-sized farm-house,
with brick floor, an ample "dresser," and a big range,
flanked with its pair of ovens, and just now redolent of
the steam of juicy South-down mutton and fresh vegetables
about to be served for the patients' dinners.</p>

<p>It is a property of the Seaford air to make even
persons with delicate appetites ready for three plain
meals a day, with a meat supper to follow, and the convalescents
are no exception to the rule. Tea and bread-and-butter
for breakfast, bread-and-cheese and ale for the
men, and cake and ale for the women as a snack in the
way of lunch, good roast meat and vegetables for dinner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
with occasional pies or puddings, with another half-pint
of ale; tea as usual; and a supper consisting of a slice
of meat, bread, and another draught of beer&mdash;this is the
most ordinary diet; but in many cases milk is substituted
for ale, and there is also a morning draught of milk, or
rum-and-milk, a lunch or supper of farinaceous food,
and wine or special diet, according to the orders of
the house surgeon, who visits the patients daily, or
as often as may be required. Following the odour of
the roast mutton, we see the male patients preparing
to sit down to dinner in a good-sized room, where,
to judge from the pleased and grateful faces of men and
lads, they are quite ready to do justice to the repast.
Barely furnished, and with table appointments of the
plainest kind, the dining-room is not indicative of luxury;
but the sauce of hunger is not wanting, and as we bow
our leave-taking, there are signs that the money spent at
this Seaford Hospital is well represented by the wholesome
but expensive medicine of pure food and drink in
ample quantities, prescribed under conditions which
build up the strength, and restore life to the enfeebled
frames of those to whom a month of such living must be
an era in their history.</p>

<p>The women's dining-room is, I am glad to see, more
ornamental than that of the men. The walls are bright
with gay paper, containing large and brilliantly coloured
scenery, while the wide windows look seaward, and fill
the large room with cheerful light.</p>

<p>This is all the more essential as there is no other
sitting-room for the female patients, and the more convenient
furniture, especially a low wooden couch covered
with a mattress, is adapted to the needs of those who
require indoor recreation as well as frequent rest. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
men have a separate sitting-room in the basement, not a
very cheerful apartment, but one which in the warm
summer-time is cool, and adapted for the after-dinner
doze, or for reading a book when the weather is not
quite favourable for sitting out of doors.</p>

<p>There is, by the bye, a very decided need of entertaining
and pleasant books for the patients' library at Seaford,
the few which are on the two or three shelves being
mostly old, and of a particularly dreary pattern. It is
obvious that, in an institution where, in order to meet the
constant needs of those who seek its aid, every shilling
must be carefully expended, only a small sum can be
devoted to literature; but it may only have to be made
known that the convalescents really need a few cheerful
volumes to help them along the road from sickness to
health, and out of the abundance of some teeming
library the goodwill offering may be made.</p>

<p>It is time that we&mdash;that is to say, the kindly and judicious
secretary, Mr. Horace Green, the examining physician,
Dr. Lomas, and the present writer&mdash;should yield to
the influences of the grand appetising climate of this airy
nook of the English coast, and after a short turn into the
poultry-yard, a glance at the deliberate cow, and a passing
greeting to the great black cat with collar and bell and
a mew that is almost a deep bass roar, and to the most
exacting, ugly, and voracious pet dog it was ever my lot
to encounter&mdash;we accept the invitation to test the quality
of the Southdown mutton and other Seaford fare, with a
following of that delicately boiled rice and jam to which
the healthy palate returns with childlike appreciation.</p>

<p>On hospitable thoughts intent, the bright and active
lady who is superintendent matron of the hospital, has
for the time adopted us into her hungry family, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
the knowledge of the effects of the breeze blowing
over that high bluff, and curling the waves along the
shingle ridge, has set out a repast in her own pleasant
parlour, where she does the honours of the institution
with a simple cheerful grace that speaks favourably
for the administration which she represents. But I should
now be writing in the past tense, for the larger building
is completed. The inmates will have a better appointed
home.</p>

<p>In order to maintain the objects of the charity, and to
ensure the comfort of those for whom its provisions are
intended, some well-considered regulations have to be
adopted and enforced; and the most discouraging circumstances
with which the committee and their officers
have to contend, are those which arise from the negligence
of subscribers nominating patients, or from the
demands made on the charity by those who constantly
expect more benefits from the institution than their contributions
would represent even if they were paid three
times over.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not to be wondered at that people,
anxious to secure for their protégés the advantages of such
means of recovery as are represented by a temporary
hospital where there has only been one death in five
years, should readily contribute their guinea for the sake
of gaining the privilege, even though they may add to
that small subscription the five shillings a week which is
the sum required with each patient. What has to be
complained of, however, is that constant attempts are
made to introduce cases which are so far from being convalescent,
that they are still suffering from disease, and
require constant medical or surgical treatment. In order
to do this, nominations are frequently obtained from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
country subscribers, and it has required the constant
vigilance of the examining physician and the committee
to avoid the distressing necessity of obtaining for such
patients admission to other hospitals, or sending them
back to their own homes, not only without having received
benefit from the institution, but perhaps injured
by the journey to and fro when they were in a weak and
suffering condition.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the Seaford Hospital is
not for the sick, but for persons recovering from sickness,&mdash;those
for whom the best medicines are regular and
ample meals, grand bracing air, sea-baths, long hours of
quiet and restorative sleep, and that general direction of
their daily progress towards complete recovery, which
will often make them strong and set them up completely,
even in the twenty-eight days of their sea-side sojourn.</p>

<p>To send patients who require the medical care and
attendance which can only be provided in a hospital for
the special disorders from which they suffer, or who are
afflicted with incurable diseases, is unjust, both to the
poor creatures themselves and to the charity which cannot
receive them.</p>

<p>For consumptive patients, except in the early or
threatening stage of phthisis, Seaford is unsuitable, but
a month at the hospital for patients of consumptive tendency
has been known to produce remarkably beneficial
results. It is in cases of recovery after rheumatism and
rheumatic fever, or when strength is required after painful
or exhausting surgical operations, in nervous depression,
debility, pleurisy, and recovery from accidents, that the
fine air is found to be wonderfully invigorating; for Seaford
is high and dry, the subsoil being sand resting on
chalk, so that there is little surface evaporation, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
shelter afforded by Beachy Head screens this little bay
of the coast from the east wind.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the late Bishop
of Winchester should have joined many of the London
clergy, and more than eighty of the most eminent physicians
and surgeons connected with metropolitan
hospitals, to recommend this charity as one especially
deserving of public support. Those who are ever so
superficially acquainted with the homes and difficulties of
the poorer classes in London know that the period of
debility after sickness, when the general hospital has discharged
the patient, or when the parish doctor has taken
his leave, is a terrible time. Too weak to work, without
means to buy even common nourishment at the crisis
when plentiful food is requisite, and stimulated to try to
labour when the heart has only just strength to beat,
men and women are ready to faint and to perish unless
helping hands be held out to them. Try to imagine
some poor cabman or omnibus-driver, lying weak and
helpless after coming from a hospital; think of the domestic
servant, whose small savings have all been spent in the
endeavour to get well enough to take another place; of
the poor little wistful, eager-eyed errand-boy, scantily
fed, and with shaking limbs, that will not carry him fast
enough about the streets. Try to realise what a boon it
must be to a letter-carrier, slowly recovering from the illness
by which he has been smitten down, or to the London
waiter, worn and debilitated by long hours of wearying
attendance to his duties, to have a month of rest and,
re-invigoration at a place like this. In the table of inmates
during the last few years are to be found a host
of domestic servants, mechanics and apprentices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
warehousemen and labourers, 36 housewives (there is
much significance in that word, if we think of the poor
wife or mother to be restored to her husband and children),
46 needlewomen, 19 clerks, 15 teachers (mark that)
41 school-children, 9 nurses, 1 policeman, 3 seamen and
watermen, 1 letter-carrier, 4 errand-boys, 7 Scripture-readers,
and others of various occupations.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, I say, that the general hospitals
should regard this Convalescent Home at Seaford as a
boon; but, unfortunately for the charity, the appreciation
which it receives from some of those wealthy and magnificently-endowed
institutions operates as a very serious
drain on its own limited resources, which are only supplied
by voluntary subscriptions, contributions, and
legacies. Every subscriber of a guinea annually, and
every donor of ten guineas in one sum, has the privilege
of recommending one patient yearly, with an additional
recommendation for every additional subscription of
one guinea, or donation of ten guineas. The payment
of five shillings a week by each patient admitted is also
required by the guarantee of a householder written on
the nomination paper, and the travelling expenses of the
patient must also be paid, the Brighton Railway Company
most benevolently conveying patients to the hospital
by their quick morning train, in second-class carriages
at third-class fare.</p>

<p>Now it is quite obvious that the five shillings a week,
though it removes the institution from the position of an
absolute charity, goes but a very short distance in providing
for the needs of the inmates, and when the guinea
contribution is added to it, there is still a very wide margin
to fill before much good can be effected. Let us see, then,
what is the effect of every subscription of a guinea representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
a claim, as in the case of the patients sent
from the general hospitals.</p>

<p>The cost of those admirable medicines, food and drink,
wine, milk, and sea-baths, together with the expenses
of administration, and the rental will represent at least
£4 8s. per head for each patient, and as Guy's, Bartholomew's,
St. Thomas's, and the London Hospitals,
each subscribing their ten guineas annually, demand
their ten nominations in exchange, the account stands
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>For each case, five shillings per week for four weeks,
and one guinea subscription = £2 1<i>s.</i>, which, deducted
from the actual cost (£4 8<i>s.</i>), leaves £2 7<i>s.</i> to be paid out
of the funds of the Seaford Institution, which, on ten
patients a year, represents £23 10<i>s.</i> as the annual contribution
of this poor little charity to each of the four great
charitable foundations of the metropolis.</p>

<p>But there is now an opportunity for acknowledging
this obligation, and for recognizing the useful career
of this really admirable institution. The lease of the
present house has already expired, and the committee
have been obliged to give up possession. It is therefore
necessary to support the new hospital for those who
need the aid that such a charity alone can give, and the
building has already been erected, only a few yards
further in the shelter of the bluff, where it has provided
another home. With a commendable anxiety to
keep strictly within their probable means, the committee
have decided not to imitate a too frequent mode of proceeding,
by which a large and splendid edifice would
saddle their undertaking with a heavy debt, and perhaps
cripple resources needed for carrying on their actual
work; but they have obtained from Mr. Grüning, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
architect, a plain building which will provide for their
needs for some time to come, and may be hereafter
increased in accommodation by additions that will
improve, rather than detract from, its completeness. A
great establishment, with a hundred beds, laundries,
drying-houses, and hot and cold sea-baths on the premises,
would cost £13,000; and as the actually available
funds in hand for building purposes were not more
than £5,000, with another probable £1,000 added by
special donations expected during the year, the committee,
however reluctantly, folded up the original
plan, and estimated the cost of a plain unpretentious
building, calculated at first to receive thirty-three male
and thirty-three female patients, but capable of additions
which will raise its usefulness and completeness to the
higher demand, whenever there are funds sufficient to
pay for them. The expenditure for the new hospital
was about £7000, and, should the anticipated donations
be increased fourfold, there will be no difficulty in
crowning the work, by such provisions as will include
the full number of a hundred faint and failing men
and women within the retreat where they find rest
and healing.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Yes,</span>
and amidst the mystery of suffering and
pain,&mdash;the beginning of that discipline which
commences very early, and continues, for
many of us, during a whole lifetime, at such
intervals as may be necessary for the consummation
which we can only faintly discern when we begin to see
that which is invisible to the eyes of flesh and of human
understanding, and is revealed only to the higher reason&mdash;the
essential perception which is called faith.</p>

<p>I want you to come with me to that eastern district
of the great city which has for so long a time been
associated with accounts of distress, of precarious earnings,
homes without food or fire, scanty clothing, dilapidated
houses, dire poverty and the diseases that come of
cold and starvation. The place that I shall take you to
is quite close to the Stepney Station of the North
London Railway. The district is known as Ratcliff;
the streets down which we shall pass are strangely destitute
of any but small shops, where a front "parlour"
window contains small stocks of chandlery or of general
cheap odds and ends. The doorways of the houses are
mostly open, and are occupied by women and children,
of so poor and neglected an appearance, that we need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
no longer wonder at the constant demands made upon
the institution which we are about to visit. Just here
the neighbourhood seems to have come to a dreary termination
at the brink of the river, and to be only kept
from slipping into the dark current by two or three big
sheds and wharves, belonging to mast, rope, and block-makers,
or others connected with that shipping interest
the yards of which are, many of them, deserted, no
longer resounding to the noise of hammers. The black
spars and yards of vessels alongside seem almost to
project into the roadway as we turn the corner and
stand in front of a building, scarcely to be distinguished
from its neighbours, except for the plain inscription on
its front, "East London Hospital for Children and Dispensary
for Women," and for a rather more recent appearance
of having had the woodwork painted. But for
this there would be little more to attract attention than
might be seen in any of the sail-makers' dwellings,
stores, and lofts in the district; and, in fact, the place
itself is&mdash;or rather was&mdash;a sail-maker's warehouse, with
trap-doors in the rough and foot-worn floors, steep and
narrow stairs, bulks and baulks of timber here and there
in the heavy ceilings and awkward corners, not easily
turned to account in any other business. Some of these
inconveniences have been remedied, and the trap-doors
as well as the awkwardest of the corners and the bulks
have been either removed or adapted to present purposes,
for the business is to provide a home and careful
nursing for sick children, and the long rooms of the
upper storeys are turned into wards, wherein stand rows
of Lilliputian iron bedsteads, or tiny cribs, where forty
boys and girls, some of them not only babes but sucklings,
form the present contingent of the hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
sixty little ones who have been treated during the year.
Not a very desirable-looking residence you will say, but
there are a good many inmates after all; and the scrupulous
cleanliness of the place, as seen from the very
passage, is an earnest of that plan of making the best
of things which has always been characteristic of this
hospital at Ratcliff Cross. Some eight or nine grownup
folks, and from thirty to forty children, make a
bright, cheerful home (apart from the suffering and
death which are inseparable from such a place) in that
old sail-maker's warehouse, if brightness and cheerfulness
are the accompaniments of good and loving work,
as I thoroughly believe they are.</p>

<p>It was during the terrible visitation of cholera, nearly
twelve years ago, that this work of mercy was initiated,
and the manner of its foundation has about it something
so pathetic that it is fitting the story should be known,
especially as the earnest, hopeful effort with which the
enterprise began seems to have characterised it to the
present day. Among the medical men who went about
in the neighbourhood of Poplar and Ratcliff during the
epidemic, was Mr. Heckford, a young surgeon, who,
having recently come from India, was attached to the
London Hospital, and who took a constant and active
part in the professional duties he had undertaken. In
that arduous work, he, as well as others, received valuable
and indeed untiring aid from the ready skill and
thoughtful care of a few ladies, who, having qualified
themselves as nurses, devoted themselves to the labour
of love amongst the poor. To one of this charitable
sisterhood, who had been his frequent helper in the time
of difficulty and danger, the young surgeon became
attracted by the force of a sympathy that continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
after the plague was stayed in the district to which they
had given so much care, and when they had time to think
of themselves and of each other. They went away together
a quietly married couple; both having one special
aim and object in relation to the beneficent career upon
which they had entered in company. Knowing from
hardly-earned experience the dire need of the district,
they at once began to consider what they could
do to alleviate the sufferings of the women and children,
so many of whom were sick and languishing, in hunger
and pain, amidst conditions which forbade their recovery.
If only they could make a beginning, and do something
towards arresting the ravages of those diseases that wait
on famine and lurk in foul and f&oelig;tid alleys;&mdash;if they
could establish a dispensary where women&mdash;mothers too
poor to pay a doctor&mdash;could have medicine and careful
encouragement; if they could find a place where, beginning
with a small family of say half a dozen, they
might take a tiny group of infants to their home, and so
set up a centre of beneficent action, a protest against the
neglect, the indifference, and the preventable misery for
which that whole neighbourhood had so long had an
evil distinction.</p>

<p>The question was, how to make a beginning: but the
young doctor and his wife had been so accustomed to
the work of taking help to the very doors of those who
needed it, that all they wanted was to find a place in the
midst of that down-east district where they could themselves
live and work. Out of their own means they
bought the only available premises for their purpose&mdash;a
rough, dilapidated, but substantial, and above all, a ventilable
sail-loft with its adjacent house and store-rooms,
and there they quietly established themselves as residents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
with ten little beds, holding ten poor little patients
supported by themselves, in the hope that voluntary
aid from some of the benevolent persons who knew what
was the sore need of the neighbourhood would enable
them in time to add twenty or thirty more, when the
big upper storeys should be cleansed and mended and
made into wards. That hope was not long in being
realised, and on the 28th of January, 1868, after a determined
effort to maintain the institution and to devote
themselves to its service, a regular committee was formed
and commenced its undertakings, the founders still
remaining and working with unselfish zeal. From
twenty to thirty little ones were received from out that
teeming district, where a large hospital with ten times
the number of beds would not be adequate to the needs
of the infant population, the mothers of which have to
work to earn the scanty wages which in many cases
alone keep them from absolute starvation. The struggle
to maintain the wards in the old sail-lofts was all the
harder, from the knowledge that in at least half the
number of cases where admission was necessarily refused,
from want of space and want of funds, the little applicants
were sent away to die, or to become helpless invalids
or confirmed cripples, not less from the effects of
destitution&mdash;the want of food and clothing&mdash;than from
the nature of the diseases from which they were suffering.</p>

<p>The young doctor and his wife dwelt there, and
with cultivated tastes and accomplishments submitted to
all the inconveniences of a small room or two, from
which they were almost ousted by the increasing need
for space. With a bright and cheerful alacrity they
adapted those very tastes and accomplishments to supplement
professional skill and tender assiduous care:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
the lady&mdash;herself in such delicate health that her husband
feared for her life, and friends anxiously advised
her to seek rest and change&mdash;used books and music to
cheer the noble work, and always had a picture on her
easel, with which to hide the awkward bulges and projections,
or to decorate the bare walls and brighten them
with light and colour.</p>

<p>It was at Christmas-tide seven years ago that I first
visited the hospital, and there were then very pleasant
evidences of the season to be discovered in all kinds of
festive ornament in the long wards, and especially in the
smaller rooms, where this loving woman had attracted
other loving women around her, as nurses to the suffering
little ones; and was there and then engaged in the
superintendence of a glorious Christmas-tree. But the
time came when the hoped-for support having arrived,
Mr. and Mrs. Heckford felt that they could leave the
family of forty children to the care of those who had
taken up the work with heartfelt sympathy. They had
laboured worthily and well, but, alas!&mdash;the reward came
late&mdash;late at least for him, who had been anxious to
take his wife away to some warmer climate, in an endeavour
to restore the strength that had been spent in the
long effort to rear a permanent refuge for sick children
in that dense neighbourhood. It was he who stood
nearest to shadow-land,&mdash;he who was soonest to enter
into the light and the rest that lay beyond. Mr. Heckford
died, I believe, at Margate, after a short period of
leisure and travel, which his wife shared with him. His
picture, presented by her to the charity which they both
founded, is to be seen in the boys' ward. Another portrait
of him&mdash;a portrait in words written by the late Mr.
Charles Dickens, who visited and pathetically described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
the children and their hospital in December, 1868, conveys
the real likeness of the man.</p>

<p>"An affecting play was acted in Paris years ago, called
the Children's Doctor. As I parted from my Children's
Doctor now in question, I saw in his easy black necktie,
in his loose-buttoned black frock-coat, in his pensive face,
in the flow of his dark hair, in his eyelashes, in the very
turn of his moustache, the exact realisation of the Paris
artist's ideal as it was presented on the stage. But no
romancer that I know of has had the boldness to prefigure
the life and home of this young husband and
wife, in the Children's Hospital in the East of London."</p>

<p>What the hospital was then, it has remained&mdash;but with
such improvements as increased funds and a more complete
organisation have effected. It is still the ark of
refuge for those little ones who, smitten with sudden disease,
or slowly fading before the baleful breath of famine
or of fever, or ebbing slowly away from life by the fatal
influences that sap the constitutions of the young in such
neighbourhoods, are taken in that they may be brought
back to life, or at worst may be lovingly tended, that the
last messenger may be made to bear a smile.</p>

<p>But the hope for the future of this most admirable institution
has grown to fill a larger space. It is indeed
essential to any really permanent effort in such a district
that it should be increased, and the founders looked
forward with earnest anticipations of the time when,
gathering help from without, they could enter upon a
larger building, which will soon be completed, and will
be more adequate to the needs of such a teeming
population. The area embracing Poplar, Mile End,
Whitechapel, St. George's, Limehouse, Ratcliff, Shadwell,
and Wapping numbers some 400,000 inhabitants, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
strangely enough&mdash;as it will seem to those who have not
yet learnt the true characteristics of the really deserving
poor&mdash;many of the distressed people about that quarter
will conceal their poverty, and strive as long as they are
able&mdash;so that when at last they go to ask for aid the case
may be almost hopeless, and the delay in obtaining admission
may be fatal. There are already so many more
applicants than can be received that it may be imagined
what must be the vast amount of alleviable suffering
awaiting the opportunity of wider means and a larger
building. It would be easy to shock the reader by detailing
many of the more distressing diseases from which the
poor little patients suffer, but on visiting the wards you
are less shocked than saddened, while the evident rest and
care which are helping to restore and to sooth the sufferers
ease you of the greater pain by the hope that they
inspire.</p>

<p>It is Sunday noon as we stand here in the dull street
where, but for the sudden opening of a frowsy tavern and
the appearance of two or three thirsty but civil customers,
who are not only ready but eager to show you the way
to the "Childun's 'orsepital," there would be little to distinguish
it from a thoroughfare of tenantless houses. Ratcliff
is at its dinner at present, but we shall as we go back
see the male residents leaning against the doorposts
smoking, and the women and children sitting at the doors
as at a private box at the theatre, discussing the sordid
events of the streets and the small chronicles of their poor
daily lives.</p>

<p>But we must leave the cleanly-scrubbed waiting-room
and its adjoining large cupboard which does duty as dispenser's
room. It is dinnertime here too, or rather it has
been, and there are evidences of some very jolly feasting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
considering that, after all, the banqueters are mostly in
bed and on sick diet, which in many cases means milk,
meat, eggs, and as much nourishment as they can safely
take. Indeed, food is medicine to those who are turning
the corner towards convalescence&mdash;food and air&mdash;of
which latter commodity there is a very excellent supply
considering the kind of neighbourhood we are in. Here
and there we see a little wan, pinched, wasted face lying
on the pillow; a listless, transparent hand upon the counterpane&mdash;which
are sad tokens that the tiny sufferers are
nearing the eternal fold beyond the shadowy threshold
where all is dark to us, who note how every breath bespeaks
a feebler hold on the world of which they have
learnt so little in their tiny lives. There are others who
are sitting up with picture-books, or waiting to have their
abscesses dressed, and arms bandaged, or eyes laved with
cooling lotion. Hip-disease and diseases of the joints are
evidence of the causes that bring so many of the little
patients here, and there are severe cases of consumption
and of affections of the lungs and of the glands; but as the
little fellow wakes up from a short nap, or catches the eye
of the "lady nurse"&mdash;a lively and thoroughly practical
Irishwoman, who evidently knows how to manage, and
has come here, after special training, for the love of doing
good&mdash;they show a beaming recognition which is very
pleasant to witness. With all the nurses it is the same.</p>

<p>They are young women who, receiving small pay, have
come to devote themselves to the work for Christ's sake
and the Gospel's&mdash;that is to say, for the love of humanity
and of the good tidings of great joy that announce the
love of Him who gave Himself for us.</p>

<p>In the girls' ward there is the same freshness and cleanliness
of the place and all its belongings, the same wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
patience and courageous endurance on the part of the
baby inmates, which has been my wonder ever since we
went in. Here is a mite of a girl sitting up in bed, holding
a moist pad to her eye, her poor little head being all
bandaged. She never utters a sound, but the little round
face is set with a determined endurance. "What is she
sitting up for?" She is "waiting to see muvver." Another
little creature, who is suffering from abscesses in the neck,
submits to have the painful place poulticed only on the
condition that she shall decide, by keeping her hand
upon the warm linseed-meal, when it is cool enough to put
on. These are scarcely pleasant details, and there are
sights here which are very, very sad, and make us shrink&mdash;but
I honestly declare that they are redeemed from
being repulsive because of the evidence of love that is to
be witnessed,&mdash;the awakening of the tender sympathies
and sweet responses of the childlike heart. But for its
being Sunday&mdash;which involves another reason to be mentioned
presently&mdash;the beds would be strewed with toys
and picture-books, while a rocking-horse, which is a part
of the hospital property, and a fit kind of steed to draw
the "hospital-carriage," which is represented by a perambulator&mdash;would
probably be saddled and taken out of
the stable on the landing. On the topmost storey we
come to the real infants, the little babies, one of whom
is even now in the midst of his dinner, which he takes
from a feeding-bottle, by the aid of an india-rubber tube
conveniently traversing his pillow.</p>

<p>Everywhere there are evidences of the care with which
the work is carried on, and as we descend to the waiting-room
again we have fresh proofs of the benefits that are
being effected in the great district, by the provision
made for the little creatures, many of whom would otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
be left to linger in pain and want. For the waiting-room
is filled&mdash;filled with mothers and elder sisters and
little brothers, tearfully eager and anxious for the weekly
visit to the fifty children upstairs. Here is the secret of
the brave little patient faces in the beds and cots above.</p>

<p>It is infinitely touching to think how the prospect of
"seeing muvver" sustains that chubby little sufferer,&mdash;how
the expected visit nerves the stronger ones to endurance,
and sends a fresh throb of life through those
who are still too weak to do more than faintly smile, and
hold out a thin pale hand.</p>

<p>If Mr. Ashby Warner, the Secretary at this Hospital
for Sick Children at Ratcliff Cross, could but send some
responsive thrill into the hearts of those who, having no
children of their own, yet love Christ's little ones all over
the world,&mdash;or could bring home to the fond fathers and
mothers of strong and chubby babes the conviction that
to help in this good work is a fitting recognition of their
own mercies; nay, if even to sorrowing souls who have
been bereaved of their dear ones, and who yet believe
that their angels and the angels of these children also, do
constantly behold the face of the Father which is in
heaven, there would come a keen recognition of the
blessedness of doing something for the little ones, as
unto Him who declares them to be of His kingdom&mdash;there
would soon be no lack of funds to finish building
that great new hospital at Shadwell, which is to take
within its walls and great airy wards so many more little
patients, to help and comfort by advice and medicine so
many more suffering mothers and sisters than could be
received in the old sail-loft and its lower warehouse at
Ratcliff Cross. For the hope of the founders and their
successors has at last being realised&mdash;a larger building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
than they had at first dared to expect is to be erected
on ground which has been purchased, still within the
district where the need is greatest&mdash;and when the time
comes that the last touch of carpenter and mason shall
have been given to the new home, and the picture of
Mr. Heckford shall be hung upon another wall, there
may well be a holiday "down east"&mdash;as a day of thanksgiving
and of gratitude, to those who may yet help in
the work by giving of their abundance.</p>

<h2><i>IN THE KINGDOM.</i></h2>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Of</span>
such are the kingdom of heaven;" and "whosoever
doeth it unto the least of these little
ones, doeth it unto Me." Surely there is no
need to comment again on these sayings of
Him who, in His infinite childlikeness, knew what must
be the characteristics of His subjects, and declared
plainly that whosoever should enter into the kingdom
must become as a little child. One thing is certain, that
those who are within that kingdom, or expect to qualify
themselves for it, must learn something of the Divine
sympathy with which Christ took the babes in his arms
and blessed them. Thank God that there is so much of
it in this great suffering city, and that on every hand we
see efforts made for the rescue, the relief, and the nurture
of sick and destitute children. Would that these
efforts could relieve us from the terrible sights that should
make us shudder as we pass through its tumultuous
streets, and witness the suffering, the depravity, and the
want, that comes of neglecting the cry of the little ones,
and of those who would bring them to be healed and
sanctified.</p>

<p>Only just now I asked you to go with me to
Ratcliff to see the forty tiny beds ranged in the rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
of that old sail-maker's warehouse which has been converted
into a Hospital for Sick Children. There is something
about this neighbourhood of Eastern London that
keeps us lingering there yet; something that may well
remind us of that star which shone above the manger
at Bethlehem where the Babe lay. The glory of the
heavenly light has led wise men and women to see how,
in reverence for the childlikeness, they may work for the
coming of the kingdom, and those who enter upon this
labour of love, begin&mdash;without observation&mdash;to find what
that kingdom really is, and to realise more of its meaning
in their own hearts.</p>

<p>To the cradle in a manger the wise men of old went to
offer gifts. To a cradle I would ask you to go with me
to-day; to a whole homeful of cribs; which is known by
a word that means crib and manger and cradle all in
one&mdash;"The Crèche."</p>

<p>There is something, as it seems to me, appropriate in
this French word to the broad thoroughfare (so like one
of the outer boulevards of Paris) out of which we turn
when we have walked a score or two of yards from the
Stepney Station, or where some other visitors alight
from the big yellow tramway car running from Aldgate
to Stepney Causeway. The Causeway itself is a clean,
quiet street, and is so well known that the first passer-by
can point it out to you, while, if the inhabitants of the
district can't quite master the <i>crunch</i> of the French word,
they know well enough what you mean when you ask for
the "babies' home," or for "Mrs. Hilton's nursery." The
home itself is but a baby institution, for it is only five
years old, but it might be a very Methuselah if it were
to be judged by the tender, loving care it has developed,
and the good it has effected, not only on behalf of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
forty sucklings who are lying in their neat little wire cots
upstairs, like so many human fledglings in patent safety
cages, and for the forty who are sprawling and toddling
about in the lower nursery, or for the contingent who are
singing a mighty chorus of open vowels on the ground-floor;
but also in the hopeful aid and tender sympathy
it has conveyed to the toiling mothers who leave their
little ones here each morning when they go out to earn
their daily bread, and fetch them again at night, knowing
that they are fresh and clean, and have been duly nursed
and fed, and put to sleep, and had their share of petting
and of play.</p>

<p>The sound of the forty singing like one is not perceptible
as we approach the house, which, with its large high
windows open to the soft, warm air, lies very still and
quiet. The wire-blinds to the windows near the street
bear the name of the institution, and over the doorway
is inscribed the fact that the Princess Christian has become
the patroness of this charity, which appeals to all
young mothers, and to every woman who acknowledges
the true womanly love for children. Each day, from
twelve to four o'clock, visitors are welcomed, except on
Saturdays, when the closing hour is two o'clock, as, even
in some of the factories down east, the half-holiday is
observed, and poor women working at bottle-warehouses
and other places have the happiness of taking home their
little ones, and keeping them to themselves till the following
Monday morning. Do you feel inclined to question
whether these poor, toil-worn women appreciate this
privilege? Are you ready to indulge in a cynical fear
that they would rather forego the claim that they are
expected to assert? Believe me you are wrong. One of
the most hopeful and encouraging results of the tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
care bestowed upon these babes of poverty is that of sustaining
maternal love, and beautifying even the few hours
of rest and family reunion in the squalid rooms where
the child is taken with a sense of hope and pride to
lighten the burden of the day. Early each morning the
little creatures are brought, often in scanty clothing, sometimes
shoeless, mostly with a ready appetite for breakfast.
Then the business of matron and nurses begins.
But, come, let us go in with the children, and see the
very first of it, as women, poorly clad, coarse of feature,
and with the lines of care, and too frequently with the
marks of dissipation and of blows upon their faces, come
in one by one and leave their little living bundles, not
without a certain wistful, softened expression and an
occasional lingering loving look.</p>

<p>The house&mdash;stay, there are actually three houses,
knocked into one so as to secure a suite of rooms on
each floor&mdash;is as clean as the proverbial new pin; and
as we ascend the short flights of stairs, there is a sense
of lightness and airiness which is quite remarkable in
such a place, and is by some strange freak of fancy
associated with the notion of a big, pleasant aviary&mdash;a
notion which is strengthened by our coming suddenly into
the nursery on the first-floor, and noting as the most
prominent object of ornament a large cage containing
some sleek and silken doves, placed on a stand very little
above the head of the tiniest toddler there.</p>

<p>There is enough work for the matron, her assistant,
and the four or five young nurses who receive these welcome
little guests each morning. The rows of large
metal basins on the low stands are ready, and the morning's
ablutions are about to commence, so we will return
presently, as people not very likely to be useful in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
midst of so intricate an operation as the skilful washing
and dressing of half a hundred babies.</p>

<p>There is plenty to see in the neighbourhood out of
doors, but we need not wander far to find something interesting,
for on the ground-floor of these three houses
which form the Crèche&mdash;the babies' home&mdash;provision
has also been made for babies' fathers, in the shape of
"a British Workman," or working-man's reading, coffee,
and bagatelle room, with a library of readable books, and
liberty to smoke a comfortable pipe.</p>

<p>Of the servants' home, which is another branch of this
cluster of charitable institutions, we have no time to
speak now, for our visit is intended for the Crèche, and
we are already summoned to the upper rooms by the
sound of infant voices. Doubt not that you will be
welcomed on the very threshold, for here comes an
accredited representative of the institution, just able to
creep on all fours to the guarded door, thence to be
caught up by the gentle-faced young nurse, who at once
consigns the excursionist to a kind of square den or
pound, formed of stout bars, and with the space of floor
which it encloses covered by a firm mattress. There, in
complete safety, and with two or three good serviceable
and amiably-battered toys, the young athletes who are
beginning to practise the difficult feat of walking with
something to hold by, are out of harm's way, and may
crawl or totter with impunity. They have had their
breakfast of bread and milk, and are evidently beginning
the day, some of them with a refreshing snooze in the
little cribs which stand in a row against a wall, bright,
as all the walls are, with coloured pictures, while in spaces,
or on low tables here and there, bright-hued flowers and
fresh green plants are arranged, so that the room, necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
bare and unencumbered with much furniture, is so
pleasantly light and gay, that we are again reminded of
a great bird-cage. Out here in a little ante-room is a
connected row of low, wooden arm-chairs, made for the
people of Lilliput, and each furnished with a little tray
or table, and, drumming expectantly and with a visible
interest in the proceeding, sit a line of little creatures,
amidst whom a nurse distributes her attentions, by feeding
them carefully with a spoon, just as so many young
blackbirds might be fed. Already some of the little
nurslings are sitting up in their cribs, quietly nodding
their round little heads over some cherished specimen of
doll or wooden horse. One wee mite of a girl, quite unable
to speak, except inarticulately, holds up the figure
of a wooden lady of fashion, with a wistful entreaty
which we fail to understand, till the quick-eyed lady who
accompanies us spies a slip of white tape in the tiny
hand, and at once divines that it is to be bound about
the fashionable waist, as an appropriate scarf, and at once
performs this finishing stroke of the toilet, to the immeasurable
satisfaction of everybody concerned. This
is in the upper room, the real baby nursery, where the
age of some of the inmates is numbered by weeks only,
and there is in each swinging cot a sweet, sleepy sense
of enjoyment of the bottle which forms the necessary
appliance of luncheon-time.</p>

<p>At the heads of several of these cots are inscribed the
names of charitable donors, happy parents, bereaved
mothers, sympathetic women with babies of their own,
either on earth or in heaven, who desire to show gratitude,
faith, remembrance, by this token of their love for the
childlikeness of those they love and cherish in their
deepest memories, their most ardent hopes. In more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
than one of the little beds there are signs of the poverty
or the sickliness in which the children were born, and
the effects of which this home, with its freshness and
light and food, is intended to remedy. No cases of
actual disease are here, however, since a small infirmary
for children suffering from more serious ailments has
been added to the institution, and the Sick Children's
Hospital is but three street lengths distant.</p>

<p>The first most remarkable experience which meets the
visitor unaccustomed to observe closely, is the freshness
and beauty of the children in this place. Squalid misery,
dirt, neglect, starvation, so disguise and debase even the
children in such neighbourhoods, that squeamish sentimentality
turns away at the first glance, and is apt to
conclude that there are essential differences between the
infancy of Tyburnia or Mayfair and the babyhood of
Ratcliff and Shadwell. Yet I venture to assert that if
Mr. Millais or some other great painter were to select his
subjects for a picture from these rooms of the old house
in Stepney Causeway, he would leave the galleries of
Burlington House echoing with "little dears," and "what
a lovely child!" and popular prejudice would conclude
that from birth the little rosebud mouths were duly
fitted with silver spoons instead of being scant even of
the bluntest of wooden ladles.</p>

<p>At this Crèche at Stepney Causeway the reasons of
the true childlike freshness, alacrity, and even the engaging
impetuosity and loving confidence which characterise
these little ones, is not far to seek. As you came
up you noticed row after row of blue check bags, hanging
in a current of fresh air on the wall of the staircase.</p>

<p>Those bags contain the clothes in which these children
are brought to the Home in the morning. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
changed with the morning's ablutions, and clean garments
substituted for them until the mothers come in the evening
to fetch away their bairnies, and by that time they
have been aired and sweetened. It is noticeable that this
has the effect in many instances of inducing the women to
make praiseworthy efforts to improve the appearance of
the children, and, indeed, the whole tendency of the treatment
of the little ones is to develop the tenderness and love
which lie deep down in the hearts of the mothers. Even
the endearing nicknames almost instinctively bestowed
upon the tiny darlings have a share in promoting this feeling,
and the pretty rosy plump little creatures, or the quaint
expressive bright-eyed babies, who are called "Rosie,"
"Katie," "Pet," "Little Old Lady," and so on, all have
a kind of happy individuality of their own in the regards
of the dear lady who founded and still directs the institution,
and in those of the nurses who tend them. Sometimes
the names arise from some little incident occurring
when the children are first brought there, as well as from
the engaging looks and manners of the little ones themselves.
"The King," is a really fine baby-boy, the recognised
monarch of the upper nursery, but his sway is
strictly constitutional; while a pretty little wistful, plump
lassie, is good-humouredly known as "Water Cresses,"
and has no reason to be ashamed of the name, for it
designates the business by which a hard-working mother
and elder sister earn the daily bread for the family.</p>

<p>Did I say that the charge for each child is twopence
daily? Nominally it is so; and let those who desire to
know something of the real annals of the poor remember
that even this small sum&mdash;which of course cannot adequately
represent anything like the cost&mdash;is not easily
subtracted from the scanty earnings of poor women engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
in slopwork, or selling dried fish, plants, crockery,
and small wares in the streets, or going out to work in
warehouses, rope-walks, match-making, box-making, and
other poor employments, where the daily wages will not
reach to shillings, and sometimes are represented only in
the pence column. Let it be remembered, too, that the
husbands of these women (those who are not prematurely
widows, or whose husbands have not deserted them) are
employed as dock labourers, and are often under the
terrible curse of drink, or are in prison, while the women
struggle on to support the little ones, who but for this
institution, would perhaps be left&mdash;hungry, naked, and
sickly&mdash;to the care of children only two or three years
older than themselves; or would be locked in wretched
rooms without food or fire till the mother could toil
homeward, with the temptation of a score of gin-shops
in the way.</p>

<p>Each of the bright intelligent little faces now before
us has its history, and a very suggestive and pathetic
history too.</p>

<p>Look at this little creature, whose pet name of Fairy
bespeaks the loving care which her destitute babyhood
calls forth; she is only ten months old, and her mother
is but nineteen, the widow of a sailor lost at sea two
months before the baby was born.</p>

<p>Katie, of the adult age of five years, is the child of a
man who works on barges. Rosie, one of the first inmates,
has a drunken dock-labourer for a father, and her
mother is dead. Dicky represents the children whose
father, going out to sea in search of better fortune for
wife and children, is no more heard of, and is supposed
to be dead. "The King" is fatherless, and his mother
works in a bottle-warehouse. The pathetic stories of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
these children is told by Mrs. Hilton herself, in the little
simple reports of this most admirable charity. They
are so touching, that I cannot hope to reproduce them
in any language so likely to go straight to the heart as
that in which you may read them for yourself if you will
either visit the Crèche, or send ever so small a donation,
and ask for a copy of the modest brown-covered little
chronicle of these baby-lives. Standing here in the two
nurseries, where the dolls and Noah's arks, the pictures
and the doves, nay, even the baby-jumpers suspended
from the ceilings, are but accessories to the clasp of loving
arms and the softly-spoken words of tender womanly
kindness, I wonder why all one side of Stepney Causeway
has not been demanded by a discriminating public
for the extension of such an institution. Loitering in
the lower room, where one little bright face is lifted up
to mine, as the tiny hands pluck at my coat-skirt, and
another chubby fist is busy with my walking-stick, I
begin to think of the workhouse ward, where mothers
are separated from their children night and day; of a
prison, where I have seen a troop of little boys, and
a flogging-room provided by a beneficent Government
for the recognition by the State of children who had
qualified themselves for notice by the commission of
what the law called crime.</p>

<p>A pleasant odour of minced beef, gravy, and vegetables,
known as "Irish stew," begins to steal upon the air.
The wooden benches in one of the rooms are suddenly
turned back, and like a conjuring trick, convert themselves
into tiny arm-chairs, with convenient trays in front
for plates and spoons. The little voices&mdash;forty like one&mdash;strike
up a fresh chant, and a whisper of rice-pudding
is heard. So we go out, wondering still, and with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
wish that from every nursery where children lisp "grace
before meat," some gracious message could be brought
to aid and strengthen those who believe with me that
the most profitable investment of political economy, the
most certain effort of philanthropy, is to begin with the
men and women of the future, and so abate the fearful
threatenings of coming pauperism, and the still more terrible
menace of a permanent "criminal class."</p>

<p>The policy of the authorities, says Mrs. Hilton, in
her interesting narrative of the Crèche, in stopping outdoor
relief to poor widows with children is causing much
sorrow. The 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> received from the parish
secured their rent, and they managed, with shirt-making
or trouser-finishing, to earn a bare subsistence; but now
the battle for a mere existence is terrible. Doubtless,
the children would be better cared for in the House, but
mothers cannot be persuaded to give them up. One
such case has just passed under my notice; but the
woman shall speak for herself. "'Oh, Mrs. Hilton, they
have taken off my relief!&mdash;I, with four little ones who
cannot even put on their shoes and stockings. They
offer me the House; but I never can give up my children.
Look at baby; he is ten months old; his father died
of small-pox six months before he was born; he was
only ill five days.' I told her I was afraid she would
not be able to earn enough to keep them all. 'Well,'
she said, 'I must try&mdash;I will never go into the House.'"</p>

<p>"But these women have very little feeling for their
children, they are so low and brutalised." Are they?
Let those who think so visit this Cradle Home, and
witness the bearing of the mothers who come to take
their little ones home, or to nurse the sucklings at intervals
snatched from work. Let them hear what such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
poor women will do for children <i>not</i> their own, even to
the extent (as recently took place, in one instance, at
least) of sharing with their less necessitous babes the
natural sustenance that the mother cannot always
give.</p>

<p>Sixty-five children received daily and a hundred or
more on the books, with space needed for many more
than can be admitted; children who, some of them infants
as they are, have learned to lisp profane oaths and babble
in foul language, and to give way to furious outbursts of
passion, the result of neglect and evil example, and the
life of the street and the gutter. It is but a short time,
however, before this strange dreadful phase of the distorted
child mind disappears, and the pet name is bestowed
along with the gentle kindness that obliterates
the evil mimicry of sin. The baby taken home from
this purer atmosphere of love becomes a messenger of
grace to many a poor household, as the short annals of
the Crèche will tell; and even the pet names themselves
are adopted by the mothers in speaking of and to their
own children. One short story from the first report sent
out by Mrs. Hilton, and we will go our way with a hope
that some words of ours may win a fresh interest for these
little ones.</p>

<p>"A precious babe died, and the mother, too poor to
bury it, sent for a parish coffin. The child was very
dear to us, and we had named her our nursery Queen
which had degenerated into 'Queenie.' It was a sore
trial to us to see the golden curls mingled with sawdust,
which is all that was placed in the coffin; and yet we
could not spend public funds on the funeral, and feared
to do it privately. In a few hours a mother came and
said, 'Come and look at your Queenie now.' We went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
and saw that loving hands had softened all the harsh
outlines. A little bed and pillow had been provided, a
frill placed round the edge, and some children had lain
fresh-gathered flowers on the darling's breast. The cost
had been 9½<i>d.</i>, paid for by those mothers, and although
so freely and lovingly given, it was the price of more than
a meal each."</p>

<p>If every mother in London with a well-stocked larder
would give the price of a meal for the sake of a living
child&mdash;but, there! my duty is not to beg, but to describe.</p>

quite lately I had to write about the old

of Bethnal Green is an indication as suggesting dire
poverty, neglected dwellings, poorly-paid callings, and
constant distress. Some few years ago it became quite
a fashion for newspaper special reporters (following in
the wake of one or two writers who had begun to tell
the world something of the truth of what they knew of
these sad regions) to make sudden amateur excursions
beyond Shoreditch, for the purpose of picking up
material for "lurid" articles about foul tenements, fever,
hunger, want, and crime. Bethnal Green became quite
a by-word, even at the West End, and certain spasmodic
efforts in the direction of charitable relief were made by
well-meaning people, so that for a time there was danger
of a new kind of demoralisation of the "low neighbourhood,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
and the price of lodgings, even in the wretched
tenements of its notorious streets, were expected to rise
in proportion to the demand made by emigrants from
other less favoured localities, to which the special correspondent
had not at that time penetrated. One good
work was effected by the attention of sanitary authorities
being called to the fever dens during a time of terrible
epidemic, and a certain provision of medical aid,
together with purification of drains, whitewashing of
rooms, and clearing of sties and dustheaps, was the
result. This was but temporary, however; and those who
best know the neighbourhood lying between Shoreditch
and Bethnal Green, and disclaimed by the local authorities
of both because of its misery and dilapidation, are
also aware that in various parts of the whole great
district from the Hackney Road to Bishopsgate, and
so embracing Spitalfields and part of Whitechapel, far
away to Mile End and "Twig Folly," there can be discovered
more of want, hunger, and disease than could
exist in any free city under heaven, if men were not such
hypocrites as to defy and disregard the laws which yet
they claim to have a hand in framing, and a power to
enforce.</p>

<p>Only those who are personally acquainted with such
a district can conceive what is the condition of the
children of its streets, and yet every ordinary wayfarer
of the London thoroughfares may note to what a life
some of them are committed. About the outskirts of
the markets, round the entrances to railway stations,
cowering in the shadows of dark arches, or scrambling
and begging by the doors of gin-shops and taverns, the
boys&mdash;and what is even worse, the girls&mdash;are to be seen
daily and nightly, uncared for, till they have learnt how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
to claim the attention of a paternal government by an
offence against the law. When once the child, who is
a mere unnoted fraction of the population, has so far
matriculated in crime as to warrant the interposition of
the police, he or she becomes an integer of sufficient importance
to be dealt with by a magistrate. Let an infancy
of neglect and starvation lead to the reckless pilfering
of a scrap of food from a counter, or the abstraction
of something eatable or saleable from a market-cart
or a porter's sack, and the little unclassified wretch is
added as another unit to a body recognised, and in some
sense cared for, by the State. As a member of the great
"criminal class," the juvenile thief becomes of immediate
importance. Even though the few juvenile criminal reformatories
be full, the gaol doors are open, and the
teachings of evil companionship are consummated by
the prison brand. The individual war against society
gains strength and purpose, for society itself has acknowledged
and resented it. The child has entered on a
career, and unless some extra legal interposition shall
succeed in changing the course of the juvenile offender
by assuming a better guardianship, the boy may become
an habitual thief, a full-fledged London ruffian; the
girl&mdash;?</p>

<p>It was with a deep sense of the terrible significance of
this question, that a small party of earnest gentlemen
met, twenty-seven years ago, in that foul neighbourhood
to which I have referred, to consider what should be
done to rescue the deserted and destitute girls, some of
whom had already been induced to attend a ragged
school, which was held in a dilapidated building that had
once been a stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
These thoughtful workers included among them two
men of practical experience; one of them, Mr. H. R.
Williams, the treasurer of the present institution, the
other the Rev. William Tyler, whose bright genial presence
has long been a power among the poor of that district,
where even the little ragged children of the streets
follow him, and lisp out his name as the faithful shepherd,
who both gives and labours in one of the truest "cures
of souls" to be found in all great London. To them
soon came the present honorary secretary, Mr. J. H.
Lloyd, a gentleman already familiar with teaching the
poor in a neighbouring district no less wretched and
neglected. They were the right men for the business in
hand, and therefore they began by moving sluggish boards
and commissions to put in force the sanitary laws&mdash;and,
in spite of the opposition of landlords with vested interests
in vile tenements let out to whole families of
lodgers from garret to basement, and of the malignant
opposition of owners of hovels where every abomination
was rife, and pigs littered in the yards, while costermongers
shared the cellars with their donkeys&mdash;insisted
on the surrounding streets being paved and drained, and
some of the houses being whitewashed and made weatherproof.</p>

<p>Nothing less could have been done, for the terrible
cholera epidemic was already raging in that tangle of
courts and alleys. Application was at once made for a
share from the Mansion House Relief Fund, and the
committee had to use every available shilling in order to
supply food and medicine, blankets and clothing, to the
wretched families; to visit whom, a regular relief corps
was organised, carrying on its beneficent and self-denying
work, until the plague began to be stayed. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
with scarcely any money, but with unabated hope and
fervid faith, this little company of men and women began
to consider what they should do to found a Refuge for
the children (many of them orphans, and quite friendless)
who were everywhere to be seen wandering about,
or alone and utterly destitute in the bare rooms that had
been their homes. There were already certain institutions
to which boys could be sent, for then, as now, the
provision for boys was far greater than for girls. This is
one of the strange, almost inexplicable conditions of
charitable effort, and at that time it was so obvious
which was the greater need, that the committee at once
determined to commence a building on a waste piece of
land which had been purchased close by, and to devote
it to the reception of thirty destitute girls, who should
be snatched from deadly contamination, and from the
association of thieves and depraved companions.</p>

<p>Surely, if slowly, the work went on, the plan of the
building being so prepared that it could be extended as
the means of meeting the growing need increased. Almost
every brick was laid with thoughtful care, and
when subscriptions came slowly in, the funds were furnished
among the committee themselves rather than the
sound of plane and hammer should cease; till at last,
when the King Edward Ragged School and Girl's
Refuge was completed, a large edifice of three spacious
storeys had superseded the old ruinous stable amidst
its f&oelig;tid yards and sheds, and, what was more, the
building was paid for, and a family of children had
been gathered within its sheltering walls. At the
time of my first visit to the institution no more than
twenty had been taken into this Refuge; but every
foot of the building was utilised until the money should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
be forthcoming to add to the dormitories, and enable the
committee to fulfil the purpose that it had in view.</p>

<p>In the large square-paved playground forty happy
little members of the infant-school were marching to
the slow music of a nursery song; and the numbers on
the books were 196, in addition to 304 girls who came
daily to be instructed in the great school-room, where
they were taught to read, and write, and sew. A hundred
and twenty boys were also being taught in the
Ragged Church opposite, while seventy children over
fifteen years of age attended evening classes, forty-two
young men and women were in the Bible class, and a
penny bank, a library of books, and a benevolent fund
for the relief of poor children in the neighbourhood, were
branches of the parent institution.</p>

<p>This, however, was seven years ago, and since that time
so greatly has the work flourished, that the Ragged and
Infant Schools have premises of their own on the other
side of the way; and the great building having been
completed by the addition of an entire wing, its original
purpose is accomplished, and it is "The Girl's Refuge,"
of the King Edward Certified Industrial and Ragged
Schools, Albert Street, Spitalfields.</p>

<p>It is to the receipt of munificent anonymous donations
that the committee owe the completion of the building,
and in order to extend the usefulness of their Refuge
they have certified it under the provisions of the Industrial
Schools Act of 1866. That this was in accordance
with their ruling principle of making the most of every
advantage at their command may be shown by the fact
that when the School Board, almost appalled at the need
for making immediate use of any existing organization,
began to send cases to existing "Homes," only eight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
these institutions could receive the children, and in these
eight no more than forty-four vacancies existed for Protestant
girls. The consequence of opening the King
Edward Refuge under the Act was that it received
nearly all the cases of the year, and that in the twelve
months it was certified ninety new inmates after found
an asylum within its walls.</p>

<p>If you were to go there with me to-day, you would
not wonder that the supporters of this institution were
anxious to erect another building in some part of London,
where another hundred lambs straying in this great
wilderness could be taken to the fold. Passing through
the neat dormitories, with their rows of clean white beds;
peeping into the big toy cupboard, where the kindly
treasurer has recently placed a whole family of eighty
dolls, and other attractive inventions to induce children
to play, some of whom have never known before what
play really meant; looking at the lavatory with its long
rows of basins let into slate slabs, and each with its
towel and clean bag for brush and comb; noting the
quiet "Infirmary," with its two or three beds so seldom
needed, and remarking that from topmost floor to the
great laundry with its troughs and tubs, a constant
supply of hot water provides alike for warmth and
cleanliness, I begin to wonder what must be the first
sensations of a poor little dazed homeless wanderer on
being admitted, washed, fed, and neatly clothed. Why,
the two kitchens&mdash;that one with the big range, where
most of the cooking is done, and the other cosy farmhouse-looking
nook, with its air of comfort&mdash;must be a
revelation to all the senses at once. Then there are the
highly-coloured prints on the walls, the singing of the
grace before meat; the regular and wholesome food;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
the discipline (one little rebel is already in bed, whither
she has been sent for misconduct, and an elder girl demurely
brings up her slice of bread and mug of milk
and water on a plate); the provision for recreation; the
occasional visits of parents (many of them unworthy of
the name) at stated seasons; the outings to the park,
the Bethnal Green Museum, and other places; the
Christmas treat; the summer presents of great baskets
of fruit; the rewards and prizes; the daily instruction
in such domestic work as fits them for becoming
useful household servants. What a wonderful
change must all these things present to the children of
the streets, whose short lives have often been less cared
for than those of the beasts that perish! Everywhere
there are marks of order, from the neat wire baskets at
the foot of each bed in which the girls place their folded
clothes before retiring to rest, to the wardrobe closets
and the great trays of stale bread and butter just ready
for tea. Everywhere there are evidences of care and
loving kindness, from the invalid wheel-chair&mdash;the gift
of the treasurer to the infirmary&mdash;to the splendid quality
of the "long kidney" potatoes in the bucket, where they
are awaiting the arrival of to-morrow's roast mutton,
three days being meat dinner days, while one is a bread
and cheese, and two are farinaceous pudding days.</p>

<p>As we sit here and sip our tea&mdash;for I am invited to
tea with the committee&mdash;and are waited on by three
neat and pretty modest little women&mdash;one of them, a
girl of eight, so full of child-like grace and simplicity,
that there would be some danger of her being spoiled
if she were not quite used to a little petting&mdash;who can
help looking at the inmates now assembling quite quietly
at the other end of the room, and thinking that in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
of those faces "their angels," long invisible because of
neglect and wrong, are once more looking through, calm,
happy, and with a hope that maketh not ashamed. Do
you see that still rather sullen-looking girl of thirteen.
She came here an incorrigible young thief&mdash;her father,
a tanner's labourer, and out at work from five in the
morning&mdash;her mother bedridden&mdash;her home was the
streets&mdash;her companions a gang of juvenile thieves such
as haunt Bermondsey, and make an offshoot of the
population of a place till recently called "Little Hell."</p>

<p>That girl, aged ten, was sent out to beg and to sing
songs, and was an adept in the art of pretending to
have lost money. There is the daughter of a crossing-sweeper,
who cut his throat, and yonder a child of nine,
driven from home, and charged with stealing, as her
sister also is, in another Refuge; and close by are two
girls, also sisters, who were found fatherless and destitute,
wandering about famishing and homeless, except for a
wretched room, with nothing in it but two heaps of foul
straw. I need not multiply cases: and but for the known
power of love and true human interest, in which the very
Divine love is incarnated, you would wonder where some
of these children obtained their quiet docile manner,
their fearless but modest demeanour, their bright, quiet,
sweet faces.</p>

<p>One case only let me mention, and we will go quietly
away, to think of what may be done in such a place by
the discipline of this love and true Christian interest. Do
you see that emaciated little creature&mdash;the pale, pinched
shadow of a child sitting at a table, where some of her
companions tend her very gently? She is the daughter
of a woman who is an incorrigible beggar. She has never
known a home, and for four out of her eight years of life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
has been dragged about the street an infant mendicant;
has slept in common lodging-houses; and in her awful
experience could have told of thieves' kitchens, of low
taverns, and of the customs of those vile haunts where
she had learnt the language of obscenity and depravity.
But that has become a hideous, almost forgotten dream,
and she is about to awaken to a reality in a world to
which the present tenderness with which she is cared
for is but the lowest threshold. It is only a question of
a month or two perhaps. One more bright sunny holiday
with her schoolmates in the pleasant garden of the
treasurer, at Highgate&mdash;whither they all go for a whole
happy day in the summer&mdash;and she will be in the very
land of light before the next haytime comes round. She
wants for nothing&mdash;wine and fruit and delicate fare are
sent for her by kind sympathetic hands; but she is
wearing away, not with pain, but with the exhaustion of
vital power, through the privations of the streets. From
the Refuge she will go home&mdash;a lost lamb found, and
carried to the eternal fold.</p>

<p>But another building has been found; a large, old-fashioned
mansion in St. Andrew's Road, close to the
Canal Bridge at Cambridge Heath, and there the more
advanced inmates of this original home in Spitalfields
are to be drafted into classes whence they will go to take
a worthy part in the work of the world, so soon as the
necessary subscriptions enable the committee to increase
the number of lambs rescued from the wolves of
famine and of crime.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></div>

<h2><i>WITH THE SICK.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_T.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
memory of the pleasant summer holiday
remains with many of us when we have come
back again to the duties of the work-a-day
world, and it will be good for us all if the
gentle thoughts which that time of enjoyment brought
with it remain in our hearts, to brighten our daily lives
by the influences that suggest a merciful and forbearing
temper.</p>

<p>It is perhaps remarkable that few of the charitable institutions
at places to which holiday-makers resort are to any
commensurate extent benefited by the contributions of
those visitors who, while they are engaged in pursuing
their own pleasures, seldom give themselves time to think
that as they have freely received so they should freely
give. Considering that while we are engaged in the
absorbing business of money-making, or in the exacting
engagements of our daily calling, we can afford little
time for the investigation of those claims which are made
upon us to help the poor and the needy, it might not altogether
detract from the higher enjoyment of a period
of leisure if we devoted a few spare hours to inquiring
what is being effected for the relief of suffering in any
place wherein we take up our temporary abode.</p>

<p>With some such reflection as this I stand to-day on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
the spot which to ordinary Londoners is most thoroughly
representative of the summer "outing," without which
no true Cockney can feel that he is content&mdash;a spot, too,
which has become, for a large number of English men
and women, and notably for a whole host of English
children, the synonym for renewed health and strength&mdash;the
head of Margate jetty.</p>

<p>It is a strange contrast, this moving crowd of people,
with their bright dresses and gay ribbons fluttering in
the breeze; the smiling faces of girls and women amidst
a toss and tangle of sea-blown tresses; the green sparkle
of the sea beneath the shining sky; the voices of sailors,
the shrill laughter of boys and girls coming from the
sands below; the gleam of white sails; the flitting wings
of fisher-birds; the gay tumult of the High Street;
the traffic of hucksters of shells and toys&mdash;a strange
contrast to the scene which may be witnessed in and
around that large building which we passed only yesterday
as the Margate boat stood off from Birchington, and
passengers began to collect coats and bags and umbrellas
as they saw friends awaiting them on the landing-stage
of this very jetty.</p>

<p>It seems a week ago; and just as these few hours
seem to have separated us far from yesterday's work, and
the routine of daily life, does the short distance along the
High Street and past the railway station seem to separate
us by an indefinite distance from the sickness and
pain that is yet in reality so near. Even as we think of
it in this way, the division is less marked, the contrast
not so strange, for in that building Faith, Hope, and
Charity find expression, and bring a cheerful radiance to
those who need the care of skilful hands and the sympathy
of loving hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
The name of the place is known all over England, for
within its walls are assembled patients who are brought
from the great towns of different shires, as well as from
mighty London itself, that they may be healed of that
dread malady, the most potent cure for which is to take
them from the close and impure atmosphere of their
crowded homes, and exchange the stifled breath of
courts and alleys for the boundless æther of the sea.</p>

<p>For the building, to visit which I am here to-day, is
the "Royal Sea-Bathing Infirmary, or National Hospital
for the Scrofulous Poor, near Margate," and there are at
this moment 220 men, women, and children within its
sheltering wards. Stay&mdash;let me be accurate. I said
within its wards; but here, as I pass the gates and the
unpretentious house of the resident surgeon to the broad
sea front of the building, I note that under the protecting
screen of the wall that bounds the wide space of grass-plot
and gravel-paths a row of beds are placed, and in
each of them a patient lies basking in the warm sunlit
air; while a little band of convalescents saunter gently,
some of them with the aid of crutch or stick, with the
enjoyment of a sense of returning strength. If I mistake
not, there are two or three "Bath chairs" crunching the
gravel paths a little further on, and down below upon
the space marked out and separated from the outer
world upon the beach, the two bathing-machines of the
establishment are occupied by those for whom convalescence
is growing into health.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The full meaning of such a change can only be
realised by those who know how terrible a disease
scrofula becomes, not only in the deadly insidious form
of consumption, but in the various deformities and distortions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
of the limbs of which it is the cause; and in
those cases where, to the pain and depression of the disorder
itself is added some terrible affection of the skin,
which the sensitive patient knows can scarcely fail to be
repulsive to those who witness it, unless, indeed they
have learnt to regard it only as a reason for deeper compassion
and for more earnest consolation.</p>

<p>Almost every form of the disorder is to be seen out
here in the wide northern area of this inclusive building,
which has long ago been bought and paid for, along with
the three acres of freehold ground on which it stands.</p>

<p>Of the deep sympathy with which it has been supported
by those who early learned to take an interest in
its beneficent work, the fountain which has been erected
in the centre of the green to the memory of the late Rev.
John Hodgson, one of its trustees, is a mute witness. Mr.
Hodgson laboured earnestly to secure those casual interests
which might be obtained from the vast number of
persons who visit Margate every year. In order to make
the most of small regular contributions, he appealed for
"five shillings a year," and since his death in 1870 this
fund has increased, so that in one year nearly 6,000 subscribers
had contributed £1,405 7<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Never was holiday
charity more appropriately applied, as anybody who
will visit the institution itself may witness in those long
wards beyond the open passage, to which the card of Dr.
Rowe, one of the three visiting surgeons, has directed
me.</p>

<p>Since the first establishment of the institution, seventy-seven
years ago, when sixteen cases were treated as a
beginning, above 29,000 patients, from London and all
parts of the country, have received relief; and to-day
the number in the institution (taking no account of a contingent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
of "out-patients") includes 42 men, 50 women,
and 120 children, none of whom are local cases, but all
from other parts of England, whence they come frequently
from a long distance.</p>

<p>In each of the six wards, of which four are on the
ground floor, there is a head-nurse and an assistant, with
six helpers for the children's, and four for the adult department,
beside the night nurses, who sit up in case of
any emergency. There is accommodation for 250 sufferers
and for the 40 nurses, attendants, and domestics
required for the service of the hospital; so the 220 patients
there now, represent the approaching period when a new
wing will have to be added, even if only the urgent cases
are to be admitted.</p>

<p>The year's list of occupants of the 250 beds shows a
total of 721 patients, of whom 614 had been discharged
in January, 399 being either cured or very greatly benefited,
171 decidedly benefited, and only 44 obviously
uncured; a very large amount of actual gain to humanity,
when we reflect on the conditions of the disease to
remedy which the institution is devoted.</p>

<p>If out of 721 cases 399 are either cured or have
received such marked benefit as to render their ultimate
cure highly probable, it is an achievement worthy of the
earnest work of which it is the result, a contribution to
beneficent efforts well worth the £7,966 which has necessarily
been expended in the provision, not only of the
appliances which give comfort and rest, but of the generous
food and drink which, with the glorious air from the
sea, is the medicine necessary to build up the feeble
frames and renew the impoverished blood of those to
whom meal-times come to be welcome events in the day,
instead of merely languid observances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
Down in the kitchen, with its great cooking range and
its capacious boilers, there are evidences of that "full
diet" which is characteristic of the place; and it is difficult
to decide which are the most suggestive, the long
row of covered japanned jugs which hang conveniently to
the dresser-shelf, and are used for the conveyance of
"gravy," or the mighty milk-cans standing in a corner,
ready to be taken away when the evening supply comes
in from the Kentish dairies. Half a pound of cooked
meat for dinner is the daily allowance for each man and
for every boy over fourteen years of age, while women
and girls receive six ounces, and children four ounces.
Breakfast consists of coffee and bread-and-butter, varied
in the afternoon by tea, and supper of bread and cheese
for adults, and bread and butter for children. Roast
and boiled meat is served on alternate days, with accompanying
vegetables, and there are three "pudding days"
for those who can manage this addition to the fare;
while every man and woman may have a pint of porter,
and each child a pint of table ale, at the discretion of the
doctors. This, of course, represents the ordinary diet,
in which specific differences are made for special cases
where other or daintier food is required. Perhaps I
should have said that this is the scale adopted in the refectory,
a large airy room, to the long table in which the
patients who are able to "get about" are now advancing
with a cheerful premonition of dinner. There is no space
to spare, and there are at present no funds to spend in
additional building, so that this great airy refectory is
used as chapel and assembly room. The Bread of Life,
as well as the temporal bread, is distributed here; and
those who would object to the necessity may either contribute
to build another room, or may come and learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
how every meal in such a place, and for such a cause as
this, should become a sacrament. Many varieties of the
forms taken by scrofulous disease may be seen here;
and yet the hopeful looks, the cheerful influence of the
bright summer weather, the green glimpses of the sea
through doors and windows, and the fresh bracing air,
impart to these sufferers an expressive lively briskness,
which somehow removes the more painful impressions
with which we might expect to witness such an assembly.</p>

<p>It is so perhaps in a still greater measure in these
large airy wards, where children sit or lie upon the beds,
some of them wholly or partially dressed, where the
disease has produced only deformities under surgical
treatment, or such forms of skin disease as affect the face.
Of the latter there are some very severe and obstinate
cases, and from these the unaccustomed visitor can
scarcely help turning away, but often only to <i>re</i>-turn, and
mark how cheerfully and with what a vivid alacrity the
little patients move and play, and look with eager interest
on all that is going on. For here&mdash;in the boys' ward&mdash;there
is no repression of youthful spirits, so that they be
kept within the bounds of moderate decorum, nor do the
patients themselves seem to feel that they are objects of
melancholy commiseration. To speak plainly, even the
worst cases are not reminded that there are people who
may be revolted at their affliction. Indeed I, who am
tolerably accustomed to many experiences that might be
strange to others, am rather taken aback by one little
"case," whose face and limbs, though apparently healed,
have been so deeply seamed and grooved by the disorder,
which must have claimed him from babyhood, that he
has evidently learned to regard himself as an important
surgical specimen, and, on my approach to his bed, begins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
with deliberate satisfaction to divest himself of his stockings,
in order to exhibit his legs. Hip and spinal
disease are among the most frequent and often the most
fatal forms of scrofula. One boy, with delicate and regular
features, his fragile hand only just able to clasp in
the fingers the small present I am permitted to offer him,
shows the shadow of death upon his face. In his case
the disorder has shown itself to be beyond medical, as it
has already been beyond surgical aid, and his short
hurried breathing denotes that before the summer days
have been shortened by the autumn nights, and the
leaves are lying brown and sere, he will be in a better
and a surer home, and healed for evermore.</p>

<p>It will be a peaceful end, no doubt, and he will yet
have strength enough to be taken home to die, where
other than strangers' hands will minister to him at the
last, but not more tenderly, it may be, than those that
smooth his pillow to-day.</p>

<p>As we leave the boys' wards&mdash;clean, and bright, and
fresh as they are&mdash;we encounter a cosy little party of
juvenile convalescents, who are comfortably seated on
the door-mat, engaged in a stupendous game of draughts.</p>

<p>There is more of beauty than deformity, more of life
than of death, more perhaps of living eager interest than
of sadness and sorrow to be seen here, after all; and this
is particularly remarkable in the large-windowed spacious
ward where the girls can look fairly out upon the gleaming
sea. Properly enough, the room occupied by these
young ladies has been made more ornamental than that
of the boys. The walls are gay with coloured prints,
and there are flowers, and a remarkably cheerful three-sided
stove, which gives the place an air of comfort,
though, of course, it has now no fire in it. Then some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
the girls (with those thoughtful delicate faces and large
wistful inquiring eyes which are so often to be observed
among lame people) are engaged in fancy needlework as
they lie dressed upon the beds to which they are at present
mostly confined, because of deformities of the feet
or legs requiring surgical treatment. There is a library
(which needs replenishing), from which patients are
allowed to take books; and those children who are able
to leave the wards, and are not suffering from illness, are
taught daily by a schoolmaster and a schoolmistress,
while a visiting chaplain is of course attached to the
hospital.</p>

<h2><i>BLESSING THE LITTLE CHILDREN.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_I.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I cannot</span>
yet leave that sea-coast where so
great a multitude go to find rest and healing.
The Divine Narrative may well appeal to us
in relation to such a locality, for it was by
the sea-shore that the Gospel came to those who went
out to seek Jesus of Nazareth; it was there that the poor
people heard Him gladly; there that the sick who were
brought to Him were made whole: there that He fed
the great company who lacked bread.</p>

<p>All the deeds of humanity were recognised by Him
who called himself the "Son of Man." The blessing of
little children is one of those needs of true human life
which the Lord recognised gladly. He recognises it
still; and His solemn mingling of warning and of promise
with regard to its observance, has an intensity that
may well appeal to us all, now that, after eighteen centuries
of comparative neglect and indifference, we are
discerning that the only hope of social redemption is to
be found in that care for children which shall forbid their
being left either morally or physically destitute.</p>

<p>There is a house, standing high above the sea, in that
great breezy suburb of Margate, known as Cliftonville&mdash;to
which I want you to pay a visit when the bright,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
cheerful, airy wards, the light, spacious dining-room, and
comfortable, home-like enlivening influences of the place
will entitle it to be regarded as the fitting consummation
of two other admirable institutions for the nurture
and maintenance of orphan and fatherless children.</p>

<p>The modest little building referred to is named "The
Convalescent and Sea-side Home for Orphans," Harold
Road, Margate. The parent institutions are "The
Orphan Working School," at Haverstock Hill, and that
most attractive series of pretty cottages on the brow of
the hill at Hornsey Rise, which have been more than
once spoken of as "Lilliput Village," but the style and
title of which is "The Alexandra Orphanage for
Infants"&mdash;a name, the distinguishing feature of which is
that it is immediately associated with its first patroness,
the Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>Of the Home at Margate I need not now speak
particularly, except to note that it is for the reception
of the little convalescents, who&mdash;suffering, as many
of them do, from constitutional and hereditary weakness,
which is yet not actual sickness, and recovering, as many
of them are, from the feeble condition which has been to
some extent remedied by the careful nurture, good food,
and healthy regimen, of the large institutions near London&mdash;are
not fit patients either for their own or any other
infirmary wards, and yet require to be restored to
greater strength before they can join the main body of
their young companions in the school or the playground.</p>

<p>Enough that it is picturesque and substantially pretty,
as becomes a place which is to become the home of thirty
children, taken from among nearly six hundred, the
parents of nearly half of whom have died of consumption,
and so left to their offspring that tendency to a feeble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
constitution which can be best remedied by the grand
medicine of sea-air, wholesome nutritious food, and a
judicious alternation of healthful exercise and rest.</p>

<p>It is to Mr. Joseph Soul&mdash;the late indefatigable secretary
of the Working School, with which he has been connected
for nearly forty years, and the honorary secretary of the
Alexandra Orphanage, of which he may be regarded as
the virtual founder&mdash;that the proposal to establish this
Convalescent Home was due, and its affairs are administered
at the office of the two charities, at 63, Cheapside.</p>

<p>But it is necessary to tell as briefly as possible the story
of the oldest of the two institutions of which this building
is to be an accessory&mdash;not only the oldest of these two, but
probably <i>the oldest</i> voluntarily supported orphan asylum
in London, since it dates from 116 years ago, when
George II. was King, when Louis XV. was scandalising
Europe and preparing the Revolution, when Wesleyan
Methodism was commencing a vast religious revival,
when Doctor Johnson had but just finished writing his
dictionary, and when William Hogarth was painting
those wonderful pictures which are still the most instructive
records of society and fashion as seen in the year
1758.</p>

<p>It was in that year, on the 10th of May, that fourteen
periwigged and powdered gentlemen met at the George
Inn, in Ironmonger Lane, in order to discuss how they
might best found an asylum for forty orphan children&mdash;that
is to say, for twenty boys and twenty girls.</p>

<p>They soon came to a solemn decision that there was a
"sufficient subscription for carrying the scheme into execution,"
and a record to that effect was soberly entered
in the very first clean page of the first minute-book of the
Charity, with the additional memoranda that a committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
was chosen, and a treasurer appointed to collect and take
care of the money necessary to support the undertaking.</p>

<p>The early minute-books of this charity, by the way,
are models of serious penmanship. Grave achievements
of caligraphy, with engrossed headings, elaborate
flourishes, and stiff formal hedge-rows of legal verbiage,
suggestive of the fact that the secretaries were either
attorneys or scriveners, and regarded the entries in a
minute-book or the opening of a new account as very
weighty and important events not to be lightly passed
over. In this they were probably right: and, at all
events, just so much of the old methodical exactitude
has come down to the present day in the history of the
institution, that the published accounts of the Orphan
Working School have been referred to by the <i>Times</i>
as models of condensation with a clearness of detail,
which may be regarded as the best indication of a well-ordered
and economical administration.</p>

<p>It might not be too much to say that the old principle
of carrying a scheme into execution only when there
are sufficient subscriptions still characterises the operations
of the institution. At all events, Mr. Soul had
secured enough money for the completion of the new
building at Margate before the actual work commenced,
and his experience told him that funds would be forthcoming
to maintain it.</p>

<p>The founders of the original Orphan Working School,
however, laid their wigs together to obtain a house ready
built, and at last found one adapted to the purpose, in
what was then the suburban district known as Hogsden&mdash;since
gentilised into Hoxton. Like all really good
work, the enterprise began to grow&mdash;there were so many
orphans, and this was still the only general asylum maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
by subscriptions&mdash;so that, as funds came in, two
other adjoining houses were rented, and in seventeen
years the number of inmates had increased from forty to
165.</p>

<p>Reading the formal and yet most interesting records
of this parent institution for the care of the
orphan and the fatherless, I fall into a kind of wonder at
the enormous change in the method of "nurture and admonition,"
of teaching and training, which has taken
place in the past eighty years. Even in this house at
Hoxton, whereof the founders appear to have been kindly
old gentlemen, the discipline was enormously suggestive
of that stern restriction and unsympathetic treatment
which was thought necessary for the due correction of
the "Old Adam" in the young heart. We know how
great an outcry has quite lately been made at the discovery
of the remains of that mode of chastisement
which seems to have been abandoned almost everywhere,
except by a special revival in gaols, and at two or three
of the public schools to which the sons of gentlemen are
consigned for their education.</p>

<p>The discipline at the Orphanage at Hogsden was cold
and repellent enough, perhaps&mdash;had very little about it
to encourage the affections, or to appeal to the loving
confidence of a child&mdash;but it was less barbarous than the
code which at that time found its maxim in the saying,
"Spare the rod, spoil the child." Only very flagrant
disobedience, persistent lying and swearing, were punished
with public whipping. But even in the case of ordinary
falsehood, a child was placed with his face to the wall at
meal-time, with a paper pinned to his back with the word
"Lyar" written on it, till he was sufficiently penitent to
say, in the presence of all the rest of the children, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
have sinned in telling a lie. I will take more care. I
hope God will forgive me."</p>

<p>The name, "Working School," was then interpreted so
strictly, that there was comparatively little margin for
education. Arithmetic appears to have been regarded
with peculiar jealousy by the founders of this institution,
who, being perhaps bankers, accountants, and capitalists,
looked upon such instruction as calculated to give the
poor little boys and girls notions beyond their station.</p>

<p>For ten years the teaching of figures was altogether
ignored; and it was only when some of the children,
having heard that there was a science called "summing"
known to the outer world, begged to be taught, that a
solemn meeting of the Governors was called to consider
the question, when it was conceded, after great deliberation,
and no little opposition from the anti-educational
part of the Committee, that arithmetic should be permitted
to be taught, as far as addition.</p>

<p>Thus, to their few and rigidly ordered recreations,
their hours of manual labour in making nets, list-carpets,
slippers, and other cheap commodities, to their instruction
in plain reading, and to their times for partaking of plain
and even coarse food, served in not too tempting a way,
was added the art of writing, and of the first two rules of
arithmetic.</p>

<p>This was the condition of the orphans in 1775; but still
the charity grew&mdash;grew out of house-room; and as the
funds grew also, it was determined that it should have a
building of its own, on a plot of ground in the City Road,
where, improvements having set in, the grand old charity
moved with the march of modern improvement. Life
became less hard, and instruction more extended. The
influences of modern thought and education had superseded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
the old severity, and new Governors succeeded
the bewigged and powdered founders, who had, after all,
so well ordered their work, that it increased with the
growth of intelligence.</p>

<p>During the seventy-two years from 1775 to 1847, the
institution had received 1,124 orphans; and again the
dimensions of the house were unequal to the demands of
the inmates; while the house itself, and the ground on
which it stood, had become so valuable, that it was determined
to buy a plot of land at Haverstock Hill, and
there to found a truly representative Home for 240 orphan
boys and girls&mdash;a number which has now increased (as
the building itself has been extended) till 400 orphans are
taught, fed, and clothed in one of the most truly representative
charities in all great London.</p>

<p>The obvious distress and suffering of those who are
destitute, and whose claims are constantly before us, may
lead us to forget the frequent needs of a large number of
people who represent uncomplaining poverty. There is
a tendency to identify general appeals to benevolence
with efforts for the relief of that extreme necessity which
demands immediate and almost undiscriminating aid,
and requires the prompt distribution of alms or the provision
of a meal, warmth, and shelter. Doubtless, the
actually homeless and destitute claim our first attention&mdash;especially
in the case of deserted and neglected children&mdash;and
I have tried to show what is being done for those
little ones, whose presence in the streets of this great
wilderness of brick and stone should of itself be an appeal
strong enough to move the heart of humanity in their
behalf.</p>

<p>There is, however, another class of poverty, which
makes no sign, and bears distress dumbly. There is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
need, which, without being that of actual destitution,
requires a constant struggle to prevent its representing
the want of nearly all the luxuries, and some of those
things which most of us regard as the necessaries of
life.</p>

<p>We find this among that large section of the middle
class represented by persons holding inferior clerkships,
small official appointments, and situations where the
salaries are only sufficient to yield a bare subsistence,
and there is little or no probability of their improvement,
because, among the number of candidates who are eager
to fill such positions, there exists a degree of distress not
easily estimated, even by the appearance of those who
are the sufferers. Of course, relief cannot reach such
people through the poor-law, or by any direct legislation.
They are far above the reach of almsgiving, or even of
societies for distributing bread and coals. They have a
just pride in maintaining a position of independence; and
though they may sometimes look with a feeling too near
to envy at the more prosperous mechanic or the skilled
artisan, who can earn "good wages," dress in fustian
or corduroy, send his children to the Board School, and
regulate working hours and weekly pay by the rules of a
Trade Union, they mostly keep bravely on, hoping that
as the children grow up, they may get the boys "into
something," and find some friend to help them to place
the girls in situations where they may partly earn their
own living.</p>

<p>With rent and taxes often absorbing a fourth part of
his entire income, with market cliques combining against
him to keep up the prices of food, with dear bread, dear
potatoes, boots and shoes always wearing out, and respectability
demanding cloth clothes, even though they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
be made of "shoddy," how is the clerk, the employé, the
small tradesman, the struggling professional man, to follow
the prudent counsel which wealthier people are always
ready to bestow upon him&mdash;and "lay by for a rainy day?"
Rainy day! why his social climate may be said to represent
a continual downpour, so far as the necessity for
pecuniary provision. He lives (so to speak) with an
umbrella always up, and it is only a poor shift of a
gingham after all. The half-crown which is in his pocket
to-night is already bespoken for to-morrow's dinner. As
he listens to the account of the week's marketing, and
knows that his wife and children have been living for
three days out of seven upon little better than bread and
dripping, he feels like an ogre as he thinks of the sevenpenny
plate of meat that he consumed at one o'clock,
because it was only "a makeshift" at home.</p>

<p>How is he to pay even the smallest premium to insure
his life, when he is obliged to meet ordinary emergencies
by a visit to the pawnbroker after dark?</p>

<p>Insure his life! Ah, the time may come when the hand
of the bread-winner is still, when the little money left in
the house is scarcely sufficient to pay for the "respectable
funeral" which is the last effort of genteel poverty, when
the red-eyed widow gathers her fatherless children about
her, and wonders amidst her stupor of grief what is to
become of the younger ones who yet so need her care
that she will not be able to go forth to seek the means
of living. To what evil influences may they be exposed
while she is absent striving to earn their daily food?&mdash;the
temptations of the streets for the boys: the certainty
that the elder girls must either starve at home to mind
the little ones, or must become drudges before they have
learnt more than the mere rudiments of what they should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
be taught. It is then she feels that dread of degradation,
which is amongst the sharpest pangs of the poverty which
would fain hide itself from the world.</p>

<p>It may be that the children are left a parentless little
flock, huddling together in the first dread and sorrow of
the presence of death, and the sense of utter bereavement,
and awaiting the intervention of those who are sent by
the Father of the fatherless. Then, indeed, prompt and
certain help is needed&mdash;help efficient and permanent&mdash;and
such aid can seldom be secured except by organised
institutions.</p>

<p>But let us see to what that Orphan Working School,
established in 1758, has developed in 1874. We have
but to take a short journey to the foot of Haverstock
Hill, and there, in that pleasant locality named Maitland
Park, part of which is the property of the Institution, we
shall see the successor of the old house in Hogsden Fields,
while its plain but large and lofty committee room is the
modern representative of the parlour of the George Inn,
Ironmonger Lane, where plans were first laid for the
maintenance of forty orphan children.</p>

<p>This wide and lofty building, with its handsome front
entrance and its less imposing side gate in the wing, is
the home for nearly three hundred boys, and nearly two
hundred girls, when its funds are sufficient to keep each
of the long rows of neat beds in the great airy wards
appropriated to a little sleeper.</p>

<p>I mention the dormitories first, because both on the
girls' and on the boys' side of the building these are
illustrative of the complete orderliness and excellent
management of the Institution&mdash;illustrative of what
should always be the first consideration, namely, to
bring comfort to the child's nature, to join to necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
discipline a sense of real freedom and happy youthful
confidence without dread of repression and the constant
looking for of punishment.</p>

<p>As to the appliances that belong to the building, they
are such as might almost raise a doubt in some prejudiced
minds whether we are not doing too much for children in the
present day, and thinking too constantly of their comfort.
But, alas! it needs many compensations to make up for
the loss of parents; and in any such an Institution where,
400 children form the great family, the arrangements
must be on a large scale, so that it is only a matter of
experienced forethought to combine a generous liberality
with the truest economy. Thus, there are baths, and
long well-ordered lavatories, to each wing, even to a
large plunge bath for each side; and there is a great
laundry, where the girls are taught to wash, clear-starch,
and iron, not in the regular patent steam-heated troughs
only, but in genuine homely tubs. There is a great
handsome dining-hall, with a painted ceiling, wherein the
vast troop of quiet, orderly, and happy-faced children
sit down to well-cooked wholesome meals of meat and
pudding. There are two great school-rooms, one divided
into class-rooms for the girls, and another wherein the
boys assemble to be taught, not in the narrow spirit of
the first directors of the old building in the City Road,
but with a full appreciation of the duty of giving these
young minds and hearts full opportunity to expand.
Next to the admirable evidences of <i>family</i> comfort, and
bright <i>domestic</i> influences, which pervade this place, we
may regard the efficient education of the children as the
truest sign of its liberal and enlightened management.
Not only the three R's to the extent of practised elocution,
caligraphy worthy of the old minute books of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
first scrivening secretaries, and the lower mathematics,&mdash;but
history, geography, the elements of physical science,
French, drawing, and vocal music, are among the subjects
thoroughly studied. It only needs a perusal of the
reports of the educational inspectors and examiners to
see that the work of this great hive goes on healthily.
The boys have already achieved a great position in taking
Government prizes for drawing at South Kensington;
and the girls are celebrated for their beautiful needlework.
There is but little time to walk through all the
departments of this great home&mdash;the kitchens with their
spacious larders, and store-rooms, and mighty cooking
apparatus; the great airy playgrounds; the large and
handsome room used as a chapel (for those who do not
go out to evening service), and containing its convenient
reading desk, and sweet-toned organ. Let us not forget,
however, that many of the things which add so vastly to
the beauty and completeness of the building and its
various departments are themselves gifts from loving and
appreciative supporters of the Institution.</p>

<p>But we are due at that Lilliput village on the brow of
Hornsey Rise&mdash;that series of cottage homes, where, on
each lower and upper storey, with their exquisitely clean
nursery cots and cradles, and their tiny furniture, a neat
nurse is to be seen like a fairy godmother, with a family
of chubby babies, or a more advanced charge of infants
able to run like squirrels round the covered playground
or to spend the regulation hours in that great glorious
school-room, where learning is turned into recreation, and
lessons are made vocal, gymnastic, zoological, picturesque,
or even fictional, as the times and circumstances may
dictate. "The Alexandra Orphanage for Infants" has
become so well-known amidst the numerous institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
which have been established for the care of the orphans
and the fatherless, that one might think it would be full
of eager admirers who on visiting days go to see the two
or three hundred. Why are not all the cottages full, and
each little toy bedstead complete with its rosy, tiny
sleeper, who, from earliest infancy to the maturer age of
eight years form the assembly for which Mr. Soul set
himself to provide by public appeal?</p>

<p>These, then, are the two institutions to which that
modest little convalescent home in Harold Street,
Margate, is a worthy appanage, and they may well
find support among those whose maxim it is to do with
all their might what their hands find wants doing.</p>

<h2><i>WITH THEM THAT FAINT BY THE WAY.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_T.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">There</span>
are perhaps few conditions demanding
greater sympathy and more ready aid than
that of poor women who, from temporary
sickness or the weariness that comes of hope
deferred, are unable to follow the employments, often
precarious and yielding a bare subsistence, by which
they strive to be independent of charitable aid. It is
only those who know to what extremities of need they
will submit for shame of making their poverty known,
and what mental suffering they will endure as they find
their scanty savings dwindling day by day, and their few
household goods, or even their clothing, and the little
family mementoes, which they can only part with as a
last resource, going piece by piece, who can fully
realise all that is meant by the genteel phrase, "very reduced
circumstances," as applied to women of refined
feelings, and frequently of gentle nurture, who find themselves
without the means of obtaining necessary food and
medical care when health and strength give way, and they
can no longer work at those few callings by which they
can earn enough to enable them to avoid a dreaded
"application to friends."</p>

<p>Quite lately, the subject of some kind of provision for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
poor governesses who are sick, or have to subsist during
long holidays on the small balance of their quarterly
wages, has occupied public attention, and it would be
well indeed if means could be found for giving the healthy
temporary employment, and the weakly a quiet home
where their strength might be restored without the sacrifice
of independence.</p>

<p>There are others, however, for which such help is
equally needed&mdash;the dressmaker, or the shop-woman, on
whom long hours of tedious and often of exhausting toil
in an unhealthy atmosphere, has begun to tell too
severely; the servant of good character and respectable
habits, who is not so ill as to be admitted to a hospital,
and yet is breaking down in strength, and regards with
dread the necessity for going into some obscure lodging,
where her surplusage of wages will barely pay for rent
and food during two or three weeks enforced idleness;
the girl who has learnt some ill-paid business, which
affords her no more than a mere contribution to the
family funds, and leaves no margin for extra food or medicine,
or the fresh air that is as important as either.</p>

<p>Any careful observer standing at the door of a general
hospital, and watching the throng of out-patients waiting
wearily to see the doctor, will be able to distinguish a
score of cases for which a temporary rest with wholesome
food and the sympathy and loving-kindness that refresh
the soul would bring true healing.</p>

<p>No large establishment in the nature of a hospital or a
refuge affords the kind of help for such distress as theirs.
They cannot be dealt with as occupants of wards; for
they have either recovered from the actual crisis of some
serious disorder, or are pining in a depressed condition to
which no definite name can be given to classify it for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
admission to any public establishment for the cure of
disease. To many of them the idea of entering a large
charitable refuge&mdash;and I know of none in London
adapted to such needs as theirs&mdash;would be repulsive, as
suggesting that horror with which persons even of a lower
grade regard the union workhouse; what they need is a
temporary home, and if ever the time should come when
a well-supported scheme for such a provision should be
adopted, it will have to take the form of what is now known
as the "cottage system." Indeed, in hospitals, as well
as in other large charitable institutions, the defects of the
old plan of maintaining a great number of adult persons
in one vast building have been recognised. The immense
ward with its long rows of beds, the divided and necessarily
confusing duties of attendants, the ill-served meals
at a great dinner-table where there is no possibility of
escaping from a too rigid routine, the depressing, not to
say degrading, influence, resulting from the loss of individuality,
would make any vast institution for convalescents
or invalids far less effectual in its operation. I
make this reference only with regard to the probable inauguration
of homes for invalid women in or near London,
and because I have just visited one, which, although
it is not on the cottage system, but is established in a
rare old mansion of the period of Queen Anne, has yet
the happy characteristic of being a family whose scanty
means is largely increased by loving gifts, instead of an
institution every corner of which bears a reminder that
it is "supported by charity."</p>

<p>In the pleasant airy High Street of Stoke Newington,
and within a stone's throw of the famous Cedar Walk of
Abney Park&mdash;that locality made famous by the prolonged
visit of Dr. Watts, who went to spend a week with Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
Thomas Abney, and remained for the rest of his long
blameless life the honoured guest of the family&mdash;is the
house I speak of, "The Invalid Asylum for Respectable
Females in London and its Vicinity," superintended by
a ladies' committee, and with weekly visitors, and a
matron to carry on the practical work of the executive.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkably picturesque, nothing very
striking about this home for thirty respectable invalid
women employed in dependent situations, to whom it
affords a temporary asylum, widely differing from the
crowded receptacles for the sick in the metropolis. One
of its peculiarities is, that the purity of the family circle
is maintained, by the fact that no patient is admitted
without a certificate of conduct signed by two housekeepers
or by an employer, while her case is also recommended
by an annual subscriber or life governor; and
there is a sense of repose and quiet confidence about the
inmates which is particularly suggestive of the care taken
to recognise their individual claims, and the interest
which is manifested in them during the time of their
sojourn.</p>

<p>This very quietude and sense of rest, and gradual
renewal of health and strength in a serene retreat is, in
fact, the feature which attracts my attention. It is not
too much to say that I am ready to attribute much of
such influences to the fact that the institution was originally
established by ladies representing the unobtrusive
beneficent work of the "Society of Friends," and that the
order and peace which is its delightful characteristic,
may in a great measure be traced to that foundation. At
any rate, these qualifications so identify it that I feel
justified in regarding it to some extent as a worthy
example of the method to be adopted in any institution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
which, without being altogether a free "charity," takes
only such a small sum from the patient or her friends
as suffices to keep away the degrading feeling of
pauperism, or of utter dependence on the bounty of
strangers. It is true that the principal life-governorships
include the privilege of sending entirely gratuitous
patients, but in ordinary cases the annual subscriber of a
guinea recommends the case, and when the patient is admitted,
the sum of twenty shillings is received for the
month's medical attendance, lodging, and full board,
"including tea and sugar," for a time not exeeding one
month, after which, should the case require a longer
stay, the ticket must be renewed by the same or another
subscriber, on the further payment of twenty shillings.
If the patient be in the employment of the subscriber, the
payment of this sum will suffice, without the renewal
ticket, an arrangement which should commend the institution
to every benevolent employer of female labour.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that no cases of infectious
disease are admitted, and that every applicant is examined
by the medical attendant. No patient is admitted who
is not above ten years of age; and neither "private
cookery," nor the introduction of spirituous liquors by
visitors, is permitted, any more than gratuities to servants
of the Institution.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that though a large number of
cases are received during each year, the very fact of
contributions being made by the patients themselves,
who are thus relieved from the sense of utter dependence,
appears to have prevented the Institution from
receiving as large a degree of public support as it might
command if it were an ordinary charity. This is to
be lamented, for the Institution is, after all, less a hospital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
than a temporary home, and it appeals on behalf
of a peculiar form of distress, the claims of which
are of a specific and none the less of a very urgent
character. But in order to realise the kind of work that
is most needed, and is here being accomplished, let us
pay a visit to the house itself. We have been hitherto
standing on the broad flight of steps inside the tall iron
gates, and have hesitated to sully their hearthstone
purity, for it is Saturday, and we may well have an inconvenient
sense that the short hand of the clock is
already close to the dinner-time of the institution.</p>

<p>With a long experience of paying unexpected visits, I
am prepared to encounter remonstrance, even though it
only take the form of a critical glance at my boots as a
means of possible maculation of the newly-cleaned hall
and passages. Conscious of having judiciously employed
a member of the shoe-black brigade, I can endure this
scrutiny, and, with a few words of explanation, am conducted,
by the matron herself, over the grand old house,
whose broad staircase and elaborately carved balusters of
black oak at once attest not only its antiquity but also
its aristocracy. I have already said that there is nothing
here on which to found a "picturesque description," and
yet the air of repose, the sense of almost spotless cleanliness,
the freshness of the large lofty rooms containing
from three to five or six comfortable beds with their
snowy counterpanes, the general order and pleasant seclusion,
are remarkably suggestive of the intention of the
place. Two of the patients, to whom I make my respects,
are not yet sufficiently recovered to join the daily
dinner-party in the neat dining-room. One of them, an
elderly lady, who has only just been brought here, is
slowly recovering from very severe illness, and cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
even sit up in the bed, whence she regards me with an
expression which seems to intimate that she has reached
a haven of rest. Her companion, a young woman&mdash;also
in bed in the same room&mdash;is sitting very upright, cheerfully
engaged in some problem of needlework, and
responds with a hopeful smile to the declaration of the
matron, that they "mean to make a woman of her if she
is good."</p>

<p>Close to this room is the neat lavatory with its bath,
supplied with hot and cold water, and on the landing I
note another bath, on wheels, for use in any part of the
house where it may be required. All the accessories are
home-like; and in the invalid sitting-room, on an upper
storey, where two convalescents, not yet able to get downstairs,
greet me from a pair of easy chairs, there is the
same pervading influence which distinguishes the house
from those large institutions where everything is characterised
by a depressing mechanical dead level. The library&mdash;a
pleasant cheerful room&mdash;is in course of refurnishing;
and I am glad to learn that our best known
periodicals find a place there, while the stock of books,
either gifts or loans, are likely soon to be replenished,
a matter wherein extra aid would be appreciated, and
could readily be afforded by those who have volumes to
spare.</p>

<p>Already the cloth is laid in the dining-room, and
dinner itself consists of hot meat with the usual accessories
every day, except on Sundays, when there is a cold
dinner, while, of course, the invalids who are ordered
medical diet have fish, custards, or other delicate fare
specially provided. Each patient has a pint of ale or
beer daily, and wine as a remedial stimulant, according
to the doctor's orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
There is just time before dinner is served to walk
through the room into the grand old garden which
extends from a pleasant sheltered lawn and flower-garden,
with a glorious fig-tree in full leaf and fruit
against the sunny wall, to a great kitchen-garden and
orchard, with a wealth of fruit and vegetables (and notably
a venerable and prolific mulberry tree), and extending
in a pleasant vista of autumn leaves. On the other
side of the high wall is the Cedar Walk already mentioned;
and the whole place is so still and balmy on this
autumnal day, that we may go away with a very distinct
appreciation of the rest and peace which, with regular
nutritious food, rest, and medicine, may bring restoration
to the physical health, just as the hopeful ministrations
of good and pious women who visit the home daily may
bring a sense of peace and comfort to many a weary
spirit and burdened heart.</p>

<h2>"<i>IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH.</i>"</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_T.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">There</span>
are some of whom we might be ready
to say, they dwell in that valley;&mdash;that the
shadow of death lies darkling before them,
constantly enwrapping them,&mdash;enshrouding
them in gloom. We are accustomed to think so of persons
suffering from what we call incurable diseases, some
of which are painful, occasionally agonising, others susceptible
of relief from the suffering that attends them.</p>

<p>We are so apt to forget that we are every one of us
incurable. Though we may not at present be aware of
the disease that will bear us farther and farther into that
valley, where the wings of the great angel, so seeming
dark as to overshadow all things, may yet be revealed
to us as glowing with the brightness of the light
which our unaccustomed eyes cannot behold, we are
none the less certain to succumb to it. It may be that
some of us will live to be conscious of no other than the
most fatal of all diseases&mdash;because no mortal cure has
been or ever will be found for it&mdash;incurable old age.
There have been those who lived long enough to look
calmly at the slowly lengthening shadow in the valley, and
almost to wonder if Death had forgotten and were departing
from them, leaving only the black trail behind; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
time at last came, perhaps when they had learnt to see
more than shadow, to catch the glint of the heavenly
glory beyond.</p>

<p>It is a happy thought that many poor afflicted children
of God have seen this too, and continue to see it daily,
although, like St. Paul, they also die daily. It is comforting
to believe that many who know what their disease
is&mdash;who are pronounced to be "hopelessly incurable"
in a rather different sense to that in which we may
all be declared to be hopelessly incurable also&mdash;do not
dwell perpetually in the Valley of the Shadow. Christ
has come to them and taken them out of it, that even in
this life, where He is they may be also, secure in the love
of the Father, having already, if one may so speak,
overcome death through Him who is the Resurrection
and the Life. The great, the essential difference between
these sufferers and the rest of mankind is that they are
almost always conscious of the disease which is incurable
because of its accompanying pain, and that they are disqualified
for many of the ordinary uses, and also most of
the ordinary enjoyments of life. Perhaps the chief poignant
sense of their condition is that they are no longer
capable of fulfilling the ordinary duties of life either.
They must be dependent always; and to many souls the
suspicion that they may live only to be a burden on
others, to take instead of giving, to lean upon instead of
supporting, is itself almost intolerable, until they learn
to look higher, and acknowledge that not only all the
things of the world, but we ourselves, they and theirs,
belong to God, and that life and death, height and depth,
principalities and powers, are but His creatures, incapable
of separating us from His love. The same reflection,
coupled with that of our own incurability and our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
constant liability to be stricken down with hopeless and
painful malady, should surely lead us to recognise the
duty of helping some among the thousands who have
not only lost health, but with it the means of maintaining
life, and, more sadly still, the hope of restoration to
former strength, or even temporary recovery.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the work done by convalescent
homes and hospitals; but there are those who, being sick
unto death, yet do not soon die&mdash;those who must be discharged
from hospitals uncured, in order to make room for
the curable, and who, unable to work, unaccustomed to beg,
and almost ready to meet death itself rather than sink
into sordid abject pauperism, know not whither to turn
in their dire necessity. It was to aid these that an appeal
was written twenty years ago, asking for funds to establish
an institution for the reception of those suffering
from hopeless disease. It is to see what has been the result
of that appeal that I visit the Royal Hospital for
Incurables at Putney Heath to-day.</p>

<p>It was in 1854 that Doctor Andrew Reed&mdash;to whose
indicating hand we are indebted for the installation of
many of our noblest charities&mdash;made an urgent appeal on
behalf of those who, being discharged as incurable from
various hospitals, were left helpless, and often destitute,
since, amidst all the institutions which beneficence had
founded, there was none to which they could prefer a
claim.</p>

<p>Let us see what has been done in twenty years to alleviate
what might seem to be almost hopeless suffering.</p>

<p>Let us, coming face to face with the mystery of pain,
and looking as it were from afar on that dark shadow
which yet always lies so near to every one of us, note
how in the heart of the mystery there is hidden a joyful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
hope for humanity, how in the very shadow of death
there is a light that never yet has shone on land or sea.</p>

<p>It is a still autumnal day, and, as we turn up the
wooded lane on the left of the hill leading from the Putney
Railway Station to Wimbledon, a tender gleam in
the grey clouds betokens coming rainfall. A light,
hanging drift descends upon the distant hills, and breaks
into pale vaporous shapes amidst the wooded slopes and
valleys. The yellow leaves that strew the ground lie
motionless, as though they waited for their late companions
to fall gently from the branches overhead and
join their silent company.</p>

<p>Coming into a broader roadway, and passing through
the gate of a lodge, we come almost suddenly upon a
glorious sloping lawn, adorned with goodly trees, worthy
of the great building&mdash;meant for a ducal residence, and
now put to nobler uses&mdash;which, for all its stately look,
has about it a home-likeness that is full of promise. Even
the matchless landscape lying around it&mdash;the expanse of
wood and dale, the soft slopes of Surrey hills, the deep-embowered
glades where the bronze-and-gold of moving
tree-tops takes a changeful sheen from slowly-drifting
clouds, or reflects strange gleams of colour from the
glistening silver of the rain&mdash;will not hold us from the
nearer glow of windows bright with flowers, which give a
festal look to the place, although it is so quiet that we
stand and imagine for a moment what it is that we
have come to see. For this great mansion, with its long
rows of windows and wide-spreading wings, is the home
of a hundred and fifty-four men and women, some of
whom have been suddenly stricken down, others having
slowly fallen day by day into a condition of incurable
disease, and, in many cases, also into a condition of
utter bodily helplessness. They, and the attendants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
whose constant kindly services are essential for their
relief, constitute the family of what is known, plainly
enough, as "The Royal Hospital for Incurables." There
are no distinctions among its members, though in their
previous lives they have belonged to various grades&mdash;no
distinctions, at least, except those which arise from personal
qualifications.</p>

<p>The claim for election to the benefits of the charity is
the necessity which is implied in the name of the institution
itself: and once within its sheltering walls the patients,
whose failing eyes brighten, and whose wan cheeks
flush with every loving mention of it as their home, are
all alike sharers in its benefits.</p>

<p>Not only the 154 at present within its walls, however,
but 327 of those who, having family and friends with
whom to dwell, receive pensions of £20 a year each, and
so cease to be a heavy burden to others.</p>

<p>Do you think at first sight, and from the external
appearance of the building, that charity here has gone
beyond precedent in providing such a place&mdash;a palatial
pile standing amidst scenery that one might well come
far to see? Remember what is the need of those who
have to be lifted out of the dark, hopeless depths of
what is almost despair; of those who, finding themselves
banished from hospital wards, unable to earn their bread,
feeling themselves a burden upon those for whom they
would almost consent to die rather than live upon their
poverty; of those who, in the midst of hourly pain, have
the mental anguish of knowing that the long calendar of
darkening days may find them utterly dependent on the
toil of others most dear to them, and whose few expedients
can bring little ease, and will not serve to hide
the ever-present sense of disappointment and distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
Think how much wealth is wasted daily in the world,
and what a small part of it suffices to lighten by every
available means the burden of such lives as these; the
sorrow of those who, in the dreadful deprivation of what
to us seems almost all that makes life dear, have no
resource between that provided for them in such a place
as this and the infirmary-ward of a workhouse, amidst
sordid surroundings and the hard, mechanical, unfeeling
officialism which in such cases is little more than organised
neglect.</p>

<p>There are people who would reduce all charitable institutions&mdash;yes,
even such as this, of which living personal
interest and the care that comes of more than
merely casual benevolence are the very foundation and
corner-stone&mdash;to a dead level of official rule, in which
benevolence should be represented by a mechanical department,
and the sentiment of charity by a self-elected
board of control, dealing with public subscriptions as
though they were a poor-rate, and recognising neither
individual interest nor the right of contributors to give it
expression. Such a system would lack the very qualification
most needed here, and to be found only in that
voluntary personal interest that brings to the recipients
of bounty more than the mere bounty itself, the heart-throb
of sympathy, the feeling that the gift means more
than the cold official recognition of a national duty, that
it is the expression of loving-kindness ever active and
living; and so making for the helpless, the destitute, and
the dying, not a mere asylum, but a home.</p>

<p>The entrance into the hall of a cheerful, genial gentleman,
with a kindly, brisk manner, and a reassuring expression
of deliberation and repose in his observant face and easy
bearing, rouses us from melancholy fancies, and with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
few words of courteous welcome we are at once conducted
to the door that is to open to us the first scene in this
wonderful visit.</p>

<p>A spacious assembly room&mdash;let us call it by the good
old name of "parlour," for there is much quietly animated
talk going on&mdash;talk, and needlework of all kinds, from
the knitting of a warm woollen shawl to the manipulation
of delicate lace, and the deft handling of implements
for making those exquisite tortures of society known as
antimacassars. With ever so wide an experience of
halls, salons, suites, or drawing-rooms, the visitor can see
nothing resembling this wonderful parlour elsewhere. A
room of noble proportions, one end of which is occupied
by an organ; the great windows reaching almost from
floor to ceiling, and overlooking a broad expanse of lawn,
with a glorious view of hill and woodland beyond; on the
tables flowers, books, ornaments; in every kind of couch
and chair&mdash;many of which are comfortable beds on wheels
and springs&mdash;a company of women, with bright, cheerful,
intelligent faces, full of a recent interest, and, even in
cases where some paroxysm of pain is passing, with a
certain serene satisfaction which it is infinitely good to see.</p>

<p>There has been a morning service, conducted by a
visiting clergyman, and there is a general expression of
approval which, if the reverend gentleman himself were
present to witness it, would surely prove highly gratifying.
The congregation has settled down to easy talk,
and has resumed its occupation of plain and fancy needlework.
Here is an old lady whose silver hair adds to her
natural grace and dignity, who is busy with wool-knitting,
and at the same time engages in a discriminating
criticism of the address to one of the many visitors who
sit and spend an hour of their afternoon in agreeable chat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
There is a pretty but rather sad-eyed <i>mignon</i> lady, whose
excellently-fitting silk dress, delicate hands, and general
"niceness" of appearance, quite prepare us to see the
beautiful examples of all kinds of fancy work of which
she never seems to tire. Every year, in June, they hold
a grand bazaar at the hospital, so that those who are
skilful and capable are able to earn enough money to
clothe themselves as they please&mdash;everything except
clothing being found by the charity, except to two or
three inmates who are able to pay for their own maintenance.
Now we hear the low tones of cheerful talk,
the pleasant ripple of laughter&mdash;note the brightening
glance, the quick smile, the feeble but earnest finger-clasp
which greets the cheerful salutation of the house governor,
Mr. Darbyshire, or the presence of his wife, the lady
matron of this great happy family of incurables, we begin
to wonder at our gloomy estimate of the place before
this visit.</p>

<p>Nor is the revelation of cheerfulness, of light in
shadow, less remarkable in the dormitories themselves.
But then what rooms they are! Each bed is, as it
were, set in an alcove of its own snow-white hangings,
relieved by bits of colour which would delight an
artist's eye&mdash;pieces of embroidery, framed illuminated
texts, bright flecks of Berlin woolwork, or glistening
designs in beads, or deep glowing knick-knacks wrought
in silk and lace. Each little bedside table, though it
may hold medicine and diet&mdash;drink and requisites for
the sick&mdash;is decked with flowers and little framed pictures,
gaily-bound books, and bright-hued toys and trifles,
that make it look like a miniature stand at a fancy fair.
In some cases the sense of combined purity and glow of
colour is so great, that it is difficult to realise that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
are in one or other of a series of sick-rooms. Everything
is so spotless, so exquisitely clean and orderly, that
nothing less than perfect nursing could explain it&mdash;for be
it remembered that the place is open to visitors every
day&mdash;and amidst some of the most terrible afflictions
from which humanity can suffer there is nothing revolting.
Expressions of pain and of utter prostration and weakness
there are, of course; but even these are only alternative
with the general placid contentment and thankfulness
that is the prevailing characteristic.</p>

<p>Even in two severe cases of cancer the terrible effects
of the malady are less notable, because of the surrounding
conditions. A sprightly and engaging girl, with
features and social life alike marred and obliterated by
this dreadful malady, is surely one of the saddest of all
the sad sights in such an institution; but here the brightness
and genial influence of the place, and of those who
are its ministrants, have had their effect, and even the
half-obliterated features gain a grateful, loving, cheerful
expression; the poor eyes beam with pleasure as the
governor starts some reminiscence of that pleasant summer
water-party of his, in which one of the two sufferers had
to be carried to the boat in his arms, and both of them,
deeply veiled, were rowed by those same guarding arms
for a glorious voyage on the river, where the summer's
sunshine and gladness stole into the hearts of the sufferers,
and left a halo of remembrance that is not perhaps so
very far from the anticipations of that stream which
maketh glad the children of God.</p>

<p>Here are rooms wherein only two or three beds are
placed, while few of them contain more than six, but all
of them are bright, airy, lofty, full of space, and with the
same sense of purity. And from every window some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
fresh and lovely view of the surrounding landscape, with
all its changeful aspects, may be seen&mdash;the beds being
so placed that every patient has her own special expanse
of territory to solace her waking hours, even though she
be unable to go down to the assembly-room. Here, in a
room particularly bright and cheerful, lies a young woman
with a wealth of dark hair on the pillow where her intelligent
face beams with a certain courage, although her
body and limbs have been for years immovable&mdash;only
one arm, for an inch or two, and three fingers of the right
hand, can be stirred&mdash;and yet, as we stand and talk with
her, some small simple jest about her own condition causes
her to laugh till the bed shakes. She has learnt to write
by holding a pencil in her mouth, and inscribes neat and
legible letters on paper placed on a rest just in front of
her face. She is not only cheerful, but actually hopeful,
though she has been for years in this condition; and
her relations, great and small, visit her, to find her always
heartily determined to look on the bright side. At the
foot of her bed, near the window, is a swing looking-glass
on a pedestal, and in this she sees reflected the distant
prospect of autumn wood and field, extending miles
away. Judging from her nobly equable and smiling face,
she must be the life of the room of which she has been
so long an occupant. In another apartment a poor
schoolmistress suffering from hemorrhage of the lungs
lies reading for many hours a day, her face bearing a
painful expression, her manner eager, her constant craving
to work on, by the study of books concerning the problems
of this earthly life and the sciences that strive to demonstrate
them and yet only bring us to the barrier of the
eternal world. She yearns for one more day amidst her
classes, and for the opportunity of testing the results of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
sick-bed thoughts on a method of education which should
adapt itself to the individual temperament and mental
peculiarity of each child. Amidst a troubled tide of
thoughts that are perhaps sometimes too much for the
weary brain, she may learn to recognise the rest that
comes after hearing the Divine voice say, "Peace! be
still;" and so a great spiritual calm may fall upon her,
and give her rest.</p>

<p>Yet another visit, and we find a girl who, from an accidental
fall, is as immovable as a statue, her dark questioning
eyes and mobile face alone excepted. Yet she is
sometimes lifted into a wheel-chair that stands stabled
by her bedside, and joins the company in the great parlour
downstairs. There is another little parlour, with
quite a select coterie, under the presidency of an elderly
gentlewoman, who is busily knitting at a table, while her
friends recline at the windows, on their special couches;
and in several of the dormitories patients are sitting up,
reading, working, or looking at the fitful aspect of earth
and sky on this October afternoon. Sufferers from heart-disease,
with that anxious contracted expression so indicative
of their malady, are numerous; but the larger
number of the patients seem to suffer from rheumatism,
or paralysis&mdash;among them one lady, with silvered hair,
and yet with bright expressive eyes, and still bonny face,
who was once a well-known singer in London. She is
unable to rise from couch or bed, but the readiness of repartee,
the bright inquiring look, the quick appreciation and
retort, remain, as do a certain swift expressive action of
head and hands, which is marvellously suggestive of dramatic
gesture; for, happily, her hands and arms are still
capable of movement, and she has several periodicals on
the coverlet&mdash;among them the latest monthly part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
a magazine, in one of the stories in which she is evidently
interested. She, with two or three others, are inmates
of the hospital at their own charges.</p>

<p>We have but little time to devote to the men's side
of this great institution; but its dormitories and furniture,
its large day-room, where daughters sit talking in
low voice to fathers, sisters to brothers, wives to husbands&mdash;its
pleasant out-door contingent, who have just returned
from slowly perambulating the grounds in wheel-chairs,
or sit basking outside in the latest gleam of sunshine&mdash;its
club in the rustic hut especially appointed for this
purpose&mdash;all might bear comment. Here is a sturdy
youth, who, falling from a tree, and alighting on his heels,
incurably injured his spine, and now lies all day, mostly
out of doors, and without a coat, frequently engaged in
knitting. There is a poor gentleman, who has for sixteen
years been almost immovable, from rheumatism,
even his jaw being so fixed that he takes food through an
aperture in the teeth. He has been through two or three
hospitals, and under the care of the most eminent surgeons,
and has come here now as to an ark of refuge,
where he can read and talk, and be wheeled about
the neighbourhood on occasional visits. Only one case
of all those that we witness is startling in its melancholy
sense of terrible loss and incurability; that rigid, grimly-set
face, in the ward where the corner bed in which the
grizzled head lies is the only one occupied this afternoon.
The body belonging to that face is almost immovable&mdash;the
ears are deaf, the tongue is mute, the eyes are nearly
sealed&mdash;not by sudden calamity, but by gradual yielding
to decay or disease. He has been an inmate several
years, and is the one case here before which we may
almost quail in our solemn sense of affliction; and yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
to the touch of certain loving hands that dead
face kindles; that mind, seemingly locked in stupor,
wakes to life; that intelligence, encased in a casket iron-bound
and motionless, can understand the signs that are
made upon his own hands or forehead, and interpret them
so as to give some kind of grateful answer. It needs the
touch of the lady nurse to bring out this strange music
from an instrument so unstrung; but that it should be
done at all is an evidence of the hold that loving sympathy
and some subtle influence almost beyond mere
bodily capacity of expression has taken in these dear souls
of the sick and the afflicted. That is where the shadow
lifts, even in the darkness of the valley; that is how the
Spirit of Christ may abound; and the soul, in recognizing
the work of the disciple, may recognise the Lord therein,
and remember the Living Word&mdash;"Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for
Thou art with me."</p>

<h2>"<i>WITH THE HALT AND THE LAME.</i>"</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I suppose</span>
there are few people in England,
who are at all accustomed to keep Christmas
amidst a loving family circle, who have not
during the sacred festivities of the season,
and all the household sentiments with which they are inseparably
associated, made some reference to the "Christmas
Carol," that famous story of the great novelist whose
presence in the spirit of his books has brightened so many
a Christmas hearth, and moved so many gentle hearts to
kindly thoughts and words of loving cheer.</p>

<p>Amongst all the well-known characters to which Mr.
Dickens introduced thousands of readers&mdash;characters
who, to many of us, became realities, and were spoken
of as though they were living and among our ordinary
acquaintances&mdash;there have been none, except perhaps
little Nell, who have evoked more sympathetic recognition
than Tiny Tim, the poor crippled child of Bob
Cratchit&mdash;the child, the sound of whose little crutch
upon the stair was listened for with loving expectation&mdash;the
shadow of whose vacant chair in the "Vision of
Christmas," gave to the humbled usurer as keen a pang
as any sight that he saw afterwards in that strange
dream of what might come to pass. So completely do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
we share the anxiety of Scrooge in this respect, that we
can all remember giving a sigh of relief when, at the end
of the story, we learn that the poor crippled boy remains
to bless the fireside where even his afflictions were felt
to be a hallowing influence to soften animosities, and to
draw close the bonds of family love.</p>

<p>"Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself"
(says Bob Cratchit), "and thinks the strangest things
you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he
hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was
a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon Christmas-day who made lame beggars walk and
blind men see."</p>

<p>If I needed an excuse for so long an allusion to that
pathetic story, which has stirred so many hearts throughout
England, I might find it in the passage I have just
quoted; but I seek none. I refer to the "Christmas
Carol," because in it the figure of the crippled boy, occupying
so small a space, yet is such a living, touching
influence as to be one of the household fancies that associate
themselves with our thoughts of Christmas-tide in
poor homes; because there are so many little crutches
the sounds of which are heard&mdash;though fewer than there
used to be before <i>orthopædic</i> surgery became a special
branch of study, and hospitals were founded for its practice;
because, though Tiny Tim may represent so many
crippled children who are the helpless members of poor
families, where they are tended with as kindly care as
working fathers and mothers can find time for&mdash;there
are hundreds of other deformed or maimed lads whose
lot is made the harder because of the want of sympathy
and ready aid that would lift them out of utter helplessness,
or give them such light labour to perform as would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
diminish their sense of dependence. Finally, because I
desire you to bear me company to one place in London
where this last need is recognised, and where forty crippled
boys, suffering from various incurable deformities,
which yet have left them the use of their hands, are not
only taught a trade, but are encouraged, fed, and nurtured
for the three years during which they are inmates
of the home&mdash;"The National Industrial Home for Crippled
Boys."</p>

<p>Alighting from the railway carriage which conveys us
from Mansion House Station to the pleasant old High
Street of Kensington, we are close to the place that we
have come to see, for the building itself&mdash;a quaint old
house, with a central doorway between two projecting
deep bay-windowed fronts, and built of the reddest of
red brick&mdash;stands at the end of Wright's Lane, looking
us full in the face as we approach it to read the style and
title plainly painted across its upper storey.</p>

<p>The house has good reason for looking the world thus
bluffly in the face, for it is an independent building,
bought and paid for: hearth-stone, roof tree, and chimney,
freehold, and without debt or mortgage. Till this
was done, all thought of considerable extension was put
aside. The question was how to provide, out of voluntary
subscriptions and contributions, for the fifty inmates who
could be admitted within those sheltering walls. It must
be premised, however, that ten pounds a year has to be
paid for each boy who is accepted, during the three years
that he remains there, to be taught in the evening school
and in the workshop, not only how to read and write and
cipher, but to become a good workman at tailoring, carpentering,
or die-engraving and colour-stamping.</p>

<p>These are at present the only three trades taught in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
this truly industrial home, but they appear to be very
admirably suited to the cases of those who are deformed
or crippled in various ways; and they are taught well, as
an inspection of the work accomplished will prove. For
the workshops are real workshops, where the boys do not
play at work, but are taught their trades in a way that will
enable them when they leave the institution to gain a decent
livelihood, or even, if they can save a little money,
to go into business for themselves.</p>

<p>This has been lately done, in fact, by two youths, who,
having thoroughly learnt the relief-stamping process, have
contrived to buy a press and the materials for their trade,
and are now in partnership in a country town, and earning
a respectable maintenance. Of sixteen lads who left
during the year, twelve were doing well as journeymen
at the industries they had learnt; one had set up in business
for himself (the relief-stamping gives the greatest
facility for this); and two had returned to their friends
because of ill health, while one had not reported himself
But during the same period forty of the former inmates
had been to visit the old home, and gave a very encouraging
account of themselves. Let us add, in a whisper,
that amongst these visitors were a "team" of old boys
who had come to accept the challenge of a "team" of
the new boys, to play a match at cricket. Yes, and that
these teams of cripples have, over and over again, carried
off their bats against opponents who, if they expected an
easy victory, found themselves to have been most amazingly
mistaken. I don't think this is mentioned in the
Report, but it is well to know it, because it serves to prove
how truly beneficent a work is being done here, in removing
boys from a too often almost "hopeless" condition
to one of useful, intelligent, skilled labour, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
healthy self-forgetfulness and association in the ordinary
duties and recreations of their fellows. It must be remembered
that every boy there is, in a certain sense, incurable.
After having been nominated by the person
willing to contribute the annual payment of £10, the
medical officers of the institution (or if in the country,
some qualified practitioner) examine the candidate, who
must be above twelve and less than eighteen years of age,
and neither blind, deaf and dumb, nor without the use of
his hands. The name of the candidate is then added to
the list of those waiting for admission&mdash;of whom there
are now, unfortunately, above seventy&mdash;and when there
is a vacancy, and funds are sufficient to maintain the full
number of inmates, these candidates are taken in succession,
without voting, by order of the Committee of
Management, of whom the President is the Earl of
Shaftesbury, and the Honorary Secretary Mr. S. H.
Bibby, of Green Street, Grosvenor Square. There is
also an efficient Ladies' Committee for the household
management and for advising as to the education of the
boys, the visits of the friends of the inmates, and the
domestic affairs of the Home generally. There are some
severe cases of deformity here&mdash;club-foot, spinal curvature,
and various distortions of the legs&mdash;and in many
cases instruments are worn, but the Institution does not
profess to provide these. Frequently they are procured
by special contributions, and among the latest gifts of
this kind is a serviceable wooden leg or two, which have
had the happy effect of relieving their recipients from the
necessity of using crutches; but it is distinctly insisted
on that the Home is not a hospital, and is only curative
in the sense of improving the condition of those who,
having been pronounced incurable, are yet capable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
greatly increased activity and strength by means of
nourishing and regular food, interesting occupation, and
healthy exercise with companions who themselves are to
be numbered among the halt and the lame, and yet are,
in a very certain sense, made to walk and to leap and to
praise God. For see, at the very moment that I am
speaking, a little figure darts out of the passage yonder
and scampers across the large open green space at the
back of the house on his way to the new range of workshops
that are now nearly completed, and are also paid
for. Is it possible to apply the term cripple to such an
elf, who is out of reach before one can ask his name?
Yes; that very elf-like look is the result of a deformity
which stops growth, though it leaves the limbs as active as
you see them. But come up-stairs to the first of the
present workshops, and you may note among the colour-stampers,
sitting on their high stools before the dies and
presses, cases of more decided deformity or of crippling
by accident. These boys follow an artistic, pretty business,
and visitors may do worse than give a small or a
large order for notepaper and envelopes, stamped with
crest, motto, or quaint design. So well is the work executed,
that the Home has orders constantly in hand for
the trade, and some of the dies are really beautiful
examples of engraving. I think that in this long pleasant
upper room, with its high bench running along the window,
fitted with the presses and implements for the work, there
are more severe cases of deformity than will be seen
in either in the tailors' department on the same floor,
or the carpenters' shop below. One reflects on the
numerous accidents to which the children of the poor are
liable, such as falls down flights of stairs; to the inhuman
neglect of old women who are paid as "minders"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
by mothers compelled to go out to work in neighbourhoods
where no infant crèche, no babies' cradle home, has
yet been established, or in country towns where such institutions
have scarcely been heard of. One remembers
with pity the scores of poor little creatures who have to
nurse and tend children almost as big as themselves, so
that they and their charges too often become deformed
together, the nurse with lateral curvature of the spine and
the baby with vertical curvature or with deformities of
the feet or legs. One thinks, in short, of the many perils
to healthy life and well-formed limb that beset the children
of the poor, and then coming back to the figures of
this <i>National</i> Home, which yet, with careful management
and due economy, can only receive forty or fifty
crippled boys&mdash;wonders how long it is to be before the
ruddy old house in Wright's Lane will expand its broad
bosom and stretch out long arms on either side to embrace
three-score more lads, taken from present neglect and
want and probable ill-usage, to be fed and taught and nurtured
for three years, during which the whole future will be
changed for them, and their lives redeemed from the degradation
that had threatened them just as their bodies
expand with renewed health and strange developments of
unsuspected strength, and their souls are lighted with hope
and the sympathy of loving words and hearty manly encouragement.</p>

<p>A beginning has been made already; for that munificent
anonymous benefactor, whose thousand-pound cheques
have helped so many of our deserving charities, showed
his usual nice discrimination by taking a walk in the direction
of Wright's Lane. The result of this has been
the erection of those long workshops which extend across
one side of the wide green area, with its ornamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
trees, at the back of the building&mdash;an area which is
a good part of the acre on which the property stands,
and forms a capital recreation-ground, without quite
leaving out of sight the pleasant kitchen-garden beyond,
or the little building in the further corner, which
is intended as a cottage infirmary in cases of sickness.
There are the workshops, quite ready for another contingent
of lads, such as are now busily at work in the
tailoring department, where they are sitting on the board
in the proper tailor-fashion, sewing away at one or other
of the many private orders for gentlemen's clothes, or
"juvenile suits," which are the better appreciated because
they <i>are</i> hand-sewn, instead of being made with that
machine, at the end of the room, to learn the working of
which is, however, a necessary part of the modern tailor's
trade. Quite ready, also, for our friends the relief-stampers,
and for an additional crew of young carpenters to join
those who are now busy below amidst a fine odour of
fresh deal and the cheery sound of hammer, chisel, and
plane. One of our young friends of the wooden legs&mdash;a
strapping fellow of seventeen&mdash;is just deftly finishing
off a very attractive chest of drawers, which will only
need to be taken to the painting and varnishing rooms
that form a part of the new building to be a very
capital example of the workmanship of the establishment.
For it cannot be too strongly insisted on that the
customers of the Industrial Cripples get value for their
money, whether it be in ornamental stationery, in plain
furniture, packing cases, boxes, and general carpentry, or
in "superfine suits" to order, or "own materials made up
and repairs neatly executed." It is no sham industrial
school, but a real practical working establishment, and
when the new buildings are quite completed, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
dwelling-house has that other wing added to it, in order
to provide proper dormitories and a school-room, dining-room,
and lavatory, at all in proportion to the number
of boys who are waiting anxiously for admission&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! but the question is, When shall this be? Not
till another £5,000 is added to the funds, I am told&mdash;about
as much money as is sometimes spent in some
public display which lasts three or four hours, and going
to look at which probably half a dozen men, women, or
children are lamed and crippled in the crowd. Judging
from the present arrangements, with very little room to
spare, and a not very conveniently-adaptable space, the
money would be carefully spent; for there is no tendency
to undue luxury, and the present household staff would
still be sufficient for providing meals and looking after
the family needs of these robust and independent young
cripples. That it would be a work all the more beneficial,
because of this very independence with which it is
associated, it needs few arguments to prove; but,
should reasons be asked for, let us take three cases for
which the benefits of the Home are earnestly sought,
and they will speak in suggestive accents of the need of
that extension for which an appeal is being made. I
need not tell you the names either of those who nominate
the cases or the boys themselves; but be assured that
the former would be sufficient guarantee of the need which
it is sought to relieve:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Poor, depressed, starved, neglected, hopeless crippled
boys, how long will it be before they come here for
shelter, for hope, and renewal of life? I should ask the
question&mdash;though the answer could only be a guess&mdash;but
I am suddenly diverted by the tremendous ringing of a
hand-bell, on which one vigorous young cripple is ringing
a peal, which is almost loud enough to announce to all
Kensington that it is "tea-time." The sound has the
effect of bringing all the forty from their work&mdash;a contingent
of young carpenters staying behind for a little
while to dispose of some waste shavings which have been
swept out of some corner where they may have been in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
the way. Then they come trooping into the big room,
where they present so strange a variety of height and
appearance, and also so remarkable a diversity of twist
and lameness and distortion, that we are impressed at
once with the melancholy fact that every boy there is in
reality a cripple, and yet with the cheering reflection, inspired
by some of the lively smiling faces, that there are
vast mitigations of such afflictions&mdash;mitigations that come
so near to cures as to make our neglect of them a very
serious evil, when the means lie near at hand.</p>

<p>In this big room, which is neither dining-room, nor
kitchen, nor refectory, but a homely combination of all
three, there is no ornament, no sign of luxury, or of unnecessary
expenditure-plain deal forms or stools at
plain deal tables, on which are arranged a regiment of
full-sized mugs of good sound tea, and plates, each containing
a substantial half-pound slice of bread from a
homely two-pound loaf, spread with butter or dripping.
For breakfast the same quantity is provided, with the
substitution of coffee for tea; and dinner consists of a
half-pound of roast or boiled meat, with plenty of vegetables,
and dumplings, pies, or puddings; while bread
and cheese, or bread and butter, is served for supper.
For it must be remembered that these are working lads,
and that they require to be substantially, and, from the
nature of their bodily affliction, even generously fed, so
that these supplies of pure plain diet are not by any
means excessive; and they are such as one very ordinary
kitchen can supply&mdash;a kitchen, by the bye, which will
probably be superseded by a more convenient one when
the new wing shall be finished. Yet there is something in
these unadorned, bare, almost too plainly appointed
places, which brings with it a reassuring conviction that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
the institution has never been pampered. The dining-room,
which has to do duty for a school-room also&mdash;the
play-room, which is a rather dim kind of retreat on this
November evening&mdash;and the plain, rather bare, but still
clean and airy dormitories (especially those in the big bay-windowed
front rooms of the old red brick house), are
evidences that the place does not belie its name; that
it is really a home, but essentially an industrial home,
where work goes on as part of each day's blessing, and
the title to play freely and with a light heart is thereby
ensured.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></div>

<h2><i>WITH THEM WHO HAVE NOT WHERE TO LAY THEIR HEADS.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_T.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">There</span>
is a degree of poverty which, while it is
not absolute pauperism, often has deeper needs
than those which are alleviated by parochial
relief&mdash;a destitution which is none the less
bitter because those who suffer it cannot stoop to actual
mendicancy, and shrink from the degradation of the
casual ward and its contaminating influences.</p>

<p>Those of us who at this season of the year are surrounded
with comforts, and can meet together to enjoy them,
should feel that there is no sadder phase of the life of
this great city than that to which our attention is called
by the statistics of those same casual wards, and the accompanying
certainty that every night there are men,
women, and children, who, amidst surrounding luxury
and splendour, have not where to lay their heads, and for
whom the repellent door of the nearest union workhouse
is closed, even if they could summon such courage as
comes of desperation, and dared to enter.</p>

<p>Happily, the numbers of those who seek what is called
casual relief have diminished in proportion to the general
abatement of pauperism; and it is perhaps encouraging
to know that the applicants for nightly shelter at Refuges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
for the homeless and destitute are fewer than they were
three or four years ago. This is a fact which should be made
public, because some of these Refuges have been accused
of offering inducements to casual paupers to seek food
and shelter provided by charitable subscriptions, instead
of betaking themselves to the night-wards provided
for them at metropolitan workhouses. The complaint
was made on altogether insufficient grounds, at a time
when, during a hard winter, and with a fearful amount
of distress among the poorest class of the community, the
workhouse night-wards themselves were frequently inadequate
to the demands made upon them; while, apart
from the persons who were known as casual paupers,
there were hundreds of unfortunates suffering from
temporary starvation and the want of a place in which to
find a night's lodging, who yet were altogether removed
from what is known as pauperism, and dreaded the
abject hopelessness which they associated with "the
Union."</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten, either, that the task which
is, and was then, imposed upon the pauper on the morning
following his night's lodging and its previous dole of
gruel and bread, renders it almost impossible for the
recipient to obtain work. Before his job of stone-breaking
or oakum-picking is accomplished, the hour for commencing
ordinary labour outside the workhouse walls has
passed, and his hope of resuming independent employment,
and the wages that will provide food and lodging
for the next four-and-twenty hours, has passed also.
This alone is always sufficient to make a very marked
distinction between the regular casual pauper and the
temporarily unfortunate man or woman who, having
failed to get work, and seeking only the aid that may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
give rest and strength for a renewed effort, might look
in vain for succour but for the existence of places like
that admirable Institution to which I wish to take you
to-night.</p>

<p>The shameful spectacle of groups, and, in many
instances, of crowds, of houseless, starving, and half-naked
creatures huddled about the doors of casual wards,
to which they had been refused admission in direct
defiance of legislation, led to the establishment of Night
Refuges. There was then no time to dispute. While
boards and committees were squabbling and vilifying
each other, the poor were perishing. But even now that
a better system prevails, and pauperism has so considerably
diminished, there is much necessity for the continuance of
these institutions and their adaptation to the relief of that
kind of distress which is all the more poignant because
it is at present only temporary, but would receive the
brand and stamp of permanence if it could find no other
mitigation than that secured by an appeal to workhouse
officials, the shelter of the casual shed, the union dole,
and the daily task required in return.</p>

<p>At the time that Night Refuges were first founded, in
consequence of the failure of the Houseless Poor Act,
there were one or two institutions which went on the plan
of offering no inducement whatever to those who sought
shelter within their walls. The provisions were barer,
the beds harder, the reception little less cold and unsympathetic
than they would receive at any metropolitan
union.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who remember the Refuge for the
Houseless Poor which once stood in Playhouse Yard,
close to that foul tangle of courts that still exists
between Barbican and St. Luke's, and is known as "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
Chequers," will understand me when I say that there were
no alluring inducements for the houseless and the destitute
to seek its aid.</p>

<p>I have seldom seen a more painfully suggestive crowd
than that which waited outside the blank door of that
hideous building on a cold drizzly evening when I paid the
place a visit, only a short time before it was finally closed.
I cannot deny, however, that the applicants for admission
consisted of those persons for whom the institution
seemed to be especially designed. The very lowest class
of poverty, the representatives of sheer destitution, made
up the 350 men and the 150 women who were to occupy
the bare wooden bunks in the two departments of the
building that night, and to accept, as a stay against
starvation, the half-pound of dry bread and the drink of
water. What I would call emphatic attention to, is the
fact that this place was filled nightly at that time,
because the inmates could leave early in the morning to
seek a day's work, and so rise out of that depth of destitution
which was represented by the nightly return to the
casual ward. But let us remember that, though this
Institution could scarcely be characterised by the warm
name of "charity," it received all applicants who were
not suffering from infectious diseases, and therefore its
policy was deterrent. In order to separate itself from
the idle casual, it made its provisions little short of penal,
and, indeed, very far short of those common comforts that
are to be found in prison.</p>

<p>But the Refuge in Newport Market was one of those
which had been founded on a different principle. It was
never intended as a supplement to the casual ward, or as
having any relation to poor-law relief; though, during
the terrible distress that overtook the houseless in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
severe winter when our poor-law arrangements broke
down utterly, it was impossible for any place founded in
the name of Christian love and charity to be very particular
in excluding famishing and frozen men and women
on the suspicion that they had already somehow obtained
parochial relief the night before.</p>

<p>This "Refuge" was originally established by the influence
and the personal exertions of Mrs. Gladstone, and
a few ladies and gentlemen who, knowing of the extreme
distress that prevailed in all that poverty-stricken neighbourhood
about Seven Dials, around the alien-haunted
district of Soho, and in the purlieux of Drury Lane, and
the courts of Long Acre, set about providing some
remedy for the misery that homeless, destitute men,
women, and children had to suffer during the bitter
nights of winter. First, a regular mission was established
in an ordinary room, and, after a time, space was secured
to make a Refuge&mdash;first for six, then for ten, and afterwards
for twenty of the most destitute cases which came
under the notice of the mission-woman. This went on
till the funds were sufficient to warrant a very earnest
desire to obtain larger premises, and at last to make a
bid for that queer ramshackle old slaughter-house, which
was the rather too indicative feature of the locality. The
landlords of this place were fully alive to the value of
any property rising in proportion to the anxiety of somebody
to become its tenant, and they demanded a high
rent accordingly. Still, the work had to be done, and
the slaughter-house&mdash;cleansed, repaired, whitewashed,
and divided into several queer, irregular-shaped wards
and rooms, which were reached by strange flights of
steps and zig-zag entries&mdash;was opened with cheerful confidence
and hope, under the earnest superintendence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
the Rev. J. Williams, who was at that time incumbent of
the parish of St. Mary, Soho. It was at that period that
I first made acquaintance with the Institution, and with
the quiet, undemonstrative work of charity which was
carried on there, and is continued to this day, though it
is less arduous now that the neighbourhood itself has felt
the influence of such an organization&mdash;not so much in
the diminution of actual poverty, as in the humanising
and constantly suggestive presence of men and women
who have brought a gospel to those who were hopeless,
and seemed to have none to care for them.</p>

<p>The need to receive numbers every night to the utmost
limits of the Institution has passed now, except occasionally
during very severe weather; and though the cases
admitted are still those where deep, and sometimes apparently
almost fatal, misfortune is the claim, there is no
longer the urgency which forbade a too discriminating
selection, and the regular casual stands no chance under
the quick and experienced eye of the superintendent,
Mr. Ramsden, whose military tone and manner are,
by the way, modulated so as to carry the sense of detection
to the pretender, and to support and give courage
to the weak and faint-hearted.</p>

<p>The same complete, quiet method of receiving applicants
who await admission enables me to repeat the
impression which I received during the time that the
demands upon the night Refuge were more urgent. The
experienced visitor who stands at the gate of this rehabilitated
building that was once the old slaughter-house, and
who watches the people go in one by one, and listens to
their low-voiced pleas for food and shelter, cannot mistake
them for casual ward cases. Just as, in some other
Institutions, the pain of the spectacle is the degraded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
poverty of those who seek aid, the most affecting element
here is utter destitution, without that <i>accustomed</i>
debasement which would find a fitting resource at the
workhouse door, leading to the night shed.</p>

<p>These are broken-down men and women; old men
beaten in the battle of life, and full of present sorrow;
young men who have fought and failed, or who have
eaten of the husks, and seek occasion to rise to a better
mind; middle-aged men not altogether crushed or hopeless,
but in sore want, and needing the sound of a kindly
voice, the touch of a friendly hand; women who have
lost youth and worldly hope together&mdash;women who,
more weak than wicked, and without resource, need some
stay alike for fainting bodies and for wandering souls;
women worn and hungry, because of the lack even of ill-paid
work, and asking for rest and food till they can seek
employment: some who will go forth in the morning and
set out afresh; others who, if they can secure two or
three nights' lodging, with a mouthful of food and drink
morning and evening, have a good hope of doing better
in the future.</p>

<p>To those who know how the demand for certain kinds
of labour varies, and frequently slackens towards the
winter months, when need is sorest, this latter most merciful
provision comes with a sense of truest charity.
Tickets of admission are issued to friends and visitors of
the Institution (and any one may be a visitor who chooses
to ring at the bell of the old slaughter-house), entitling
the holder to admission after the regular evening hour of
half-past five to six, so that in bestowing one of these
the judicious subscriber (not necessarily, but surely from
sympathy a subscriber) can be a true benefactor. For
these tickets will admit the really deserving nightly for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
week, with supper of bread and coffee or cocoa, or occasional
savoury soup, and breakfast of bread and coffee.
And even this time is occasionally extended, if there be
a reasonable prospect of obtaining work. Not only
ticket-holders, but every applicant, may have the same
privilege, if it can be shown that he or she is really likely
to obtain employment. But there is more than this.
There are men here&mdash;truest of gentlemen, beyond that
social stamp of rank which rightfully belongs to them&mdash;who,
with a real, manly instinct, know how to take
poverty by the hand without offensive patronage or untimely
preaching. There are ladies who, in their true
womanhood, can see the contrition in faces bowed down&mdash;the
shame that is caused, not by evil doings, but by
the feeling of dismay which comes of having to ask for
charity&mdash;can sympathise with broken fortunes, with
gentle nurture&mdash;cast upon a hard, relentless world, with
that poverty which is "above the common."</p>

<p>More still. Among the supporters and the constant
visitors are those who can use special influence for cases
that need it most, and obtain for them admission to
hospitals and other asylums, or introduce to situations
those who by sudden calamity have been deprived of the
means of living.</p>

<p>Yes, even in their deepest need, poor, wandering, homeless
women may come here and find help, for in that
large, lofty, yet warm and well-lighted room, the women's
dormitory&mdash;one side of which is composed of a series of
niches where the comfortable beds are placed&mdash;there are
to be seen a row of doors, which seem to belong to a
series of cabins, as, indeed, they do. Each door opens
into a small bed-room&mdash;small, but with room for a chair,
a tiny table, and the neat bed. They are the lodgings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
set apart for women, who, in the midst of their poverty
and destitution, are looking forward fearfully to the time
when children will be born to them, and so to a period
of weakness, and of the sad mingling of maternal pity
and desponding sorrow. Let me say, in one line from the
Report, that last year eight young women were received
into the Refuge some time before their confinement, were
passed on to Queen Charlotte's Hospital, and were helped
until such time as they were able to help themselves.</p>

<p>I think the knowledge of this is so cheerful an instance
of the value of this most representative Refuge, that even
the sight of the bright, warm, glowing kitchen, with its
great boiler of hot coffee, and its noble kettle of soup
occupying the jolly range, scarcely imparts an extra
beam to the picture; while the long rows of white mugs,
the pleasant, clean, fragrant loaves, the big milk-cans,
the courteous <i>chef</i>, who has a true and pardonable pride
in his surroundings&mdash;no, not even the cosy, rug-covered
berths and bunks in the dormitories, nor the quaint little
corner-room to which I have to climb a crooked staircase
to shake hands with the sister who is in charge, nor the
equally quaint and cornery, not to say inconvenient,
sitting-room of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsden, who have left their
tea unfinished to do the honours of the Institution&mdash;can
suggest to me a better word to say than that which is suggested
by the picture of the poor wandering, weary, fainting
women, who, almost in despair, not only for a real, but
for an expected life, come here to find rest and peace.</p>

<p>Stay; one word more. Who are the class of people
for whom the Refuge doors are ordinarily open? Let
us see what were the most numerous cases among the inmates
who during the year received 6,669 nights' lodgings
and 16,889 suppers and breakfasts. Among the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
"labourers," of course, are most numerous; then discharged
soldiers&mdash;poor fellows who have perhaps foolishly
snatched at liberty when offered, and foregone the
advantages of re-engagement and a pension; next in
numerical order come <i>clerks</i>&mdash;a very painfully suggestive
fact, especially when read by the light of the advertisement-columns
of our newspapers, and the sad story of
genteel poverty in that great suburban ring which encircles
the wealthiest city in the world. Of house-painters
there were 24; of servants, 21; of tailors, 13; of seamen,
8; and other callings were represented in remarkable
variety, including 1 actor, 6 cooks, 1 schoolmaster, 2 surveyors,
and 1 tutor. Among the women, 199 servants&mdash;show
sadly enough the truth of the old adage, "Service
is no inheritance;" while in numerical succession there
were, 55 charwomen, 41 laundresses, 37 needlewomen,
31 tailoresses, 27 dressmakers, 26 machinists (alas! how
many women still utterly depend on "the needle" for a
subsistence!), 24 cooks, 20 ironers, 16 field-labourers.
There were 4 governesses, 1 actress, 1 mission-woman,
and 1 staymaker, the rest being variously described.</p>

<p>From among these, 94 men and 193 women obtained
employment, 77 women having been sent to Penitentiaries
and Homes, while 18 were supported in the
Refuge or elsewhere by needlework, 13 were sent to
their friends, 60 obtained permanent work, and 14 girls
of good character were sent to Servants' Homes.</p>

<p>But I have left out one thing now. Among this great
representative company of refugees were 60 children,
of whom 37 were sent to nurse or to school, while those
who were old enough&mdash; Well, just listen to that
burst of military music in a distant upper-room of the
old slaughter-house. I must tell you something about
the Newport Market boys in another chapter.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></div>

<h2><i>TAKING IN STRANGERS.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_Y.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Yes;</span>
listen to that startling clangour of military
music coming from an upper room. We are
standing, you know, in the cheerful kitchen
of that Refuge for the Homeless in the renovated
old slaughter-house in Newport Market, and I
want you to come with me to see the boys' school, which
occupies a very considerable portion of that weatherproof
but ramshackle building.</p>

<p>Only those who are acquainted with the poverty and
the crime of this great metropolis can estimate the deep
and urgent need that still exists for refuges in which
homeless, destitute, and neglected children can be received
for shelter, food, and clothing. Only the practical
student of the effect of our present administration of the
Education Act can calculate how vast a necessity is likely
to exist for the reception and instruction of the children
of the poorest, even when all the machinery of the present
School Board is put in motion for vindicating the compulsory
clause.</p>

<p>Let that clause be interpreted in the most liberal
manner&mdash;which would be in effect to provide State
education without cost to the parents&mdash;and the Act will
still leave untouched a vast number of children for whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
nothing can be done until their physical necessities are
provided for&mdash;children who are perishing with cold,
starving for want of food. A visit to some of the big
buildings recently erected by the London School Board
will reveal the fact that there are many such children
now in attendance; neglected, barefoot, half-clothed,
hungry, and with that wistful eager look, sometimes
followed by a kind of stupefaction, which may be
observed in the poor little outcasts of the streets. There
is no reasonable hope of doing much with these little
creatures till the "soup-kitchen" and the "free breakfast"
are among the appliances of education, where the
necessity is most pressing, and the children perish for
lack of bread as well as for lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>As it is&mdash;I need not refer again to the escape which is
always open from the streets to the prison. The few
Government industrial-schools to which magistrates
occasionally consign young culprits brought before them
are intended only for those who come within the cognisance
of the law.</p>

<p>The operations of these reformatory-schools are successful
so far as they go. They represent seventy-five
per cent. of successful reformatory training as applied to
juvenile transgressors committed by magistrates to their
supervision.</p>

<p>Perhaps, when we are fully impressed with the meaning
of the statistics which are published each year in
the Report of the Inspectors of Certified Schools in Great
Britain, we shall begin to consider how it will be possible
to regard destitute children in relation to the guardianship
of the state <i>before</i> they qualify themselves for
Government interposition by the expedient of committing
what the law calls a crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
The last Report states distinctly that the sooner criminal
children are taken in hand, the more complete is their
reformation. There are fewer "criminals" of less
than ten years of age than there are hardened offenders
of from twelve to sixteen. This is, so far, satisfactory;
but when we consider that (including Roman Catholic
establishments) there are but fifty-three reformatories in
England, and twelve in Scotland (thirty-seven of those
in England and eight in Scotland being for boys, and
sixteen in England and four in Scotland for girls), and
that in 1873, when the Report was issued, the sum-total
of children in all these institutions was but 5,622, of
whom one-fourth were in the Roman Catholic schools&mdash;we
cease to wonder at the vast number of homeless,
neglected, and destitute children in London alone&mdash;a
number which, notwithstanding the efforts of philanthropy
and the activity of School Board beadles, exceeds the
total of all the inmates of the State reformatories
throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>This refuge at Newport Market had included destitute
and starving boys among those who were brought to its
shelter from the cruel streets, the dark arches of railways
and of bridges, and the miserable corners where the
houseless huddle together at night, long before its supporters
could make provision for maintaining any of the
poor little fellows in an industrial-school. But the work
grew, and the means were found, first for retaining some
of the juvenile lodgers who came only for a night's food,
and warmth, and shelter, and afterwards for receiving
them as inmates.</p>

<p>Some of these are sent to the Refuge by persons who
are furnished with printed forms of application, or by
mothers who can afford evident testimony that they can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
scarcely live on the few shillings they are able to earn by
casual work as charwomen, or by the no less casual employments
where the wages are totally inadequate to
support a family; while a few lads have themselves
applied for admission because they were orphans, or
utterly destitute and abandoned by those on whom they
might be supposed to have a claim.</p>

<p>A portion of the old building, which has been adapted to
the purpose, and has been added as the need for increased
space became pressing, is now devoted to the dormitories,
play-room, and school-room of some fifty to sixty of this
contingent of the great army of friendless children; and
at the time of the last Report fourteen had but just left
to be enlisted in military bands; two had become military
tailors; situations had been found for others;
while one had been regularly apprenticed to a tailor in
London.</p>

<p>There are frequently several boys ready for such
apprenticeship, for tailoring is the only regular trade
taught, the time of the lads being occupied in learning to
read, write, and cipher, to acquire the outlines of history
and geography, and to take a place in the military
band which is at this moment making the cranky old
building resound with its performance on clarinets, hautboys,
cornets, "deep bassoons," and all kinds of
wind instruments, under the direction of an able bandmaster,
who keeps the music up to the mark with a
spirit which bespeaks confidence in the intelligence of
his pupils.</p>

<p>This confidence is not misplaced, for during the past
year eleven youthful recruits have been drafted from
among these boys into the bands of various regiments,
while there are above ninety applications still on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
books for more musicians who have chosen this branch
of the military service. It is a matter of choice, of course;
and there are some who prefer to become sailors, or to go
into situations and learn the trade of tailoring, that their
instructors may be able to recommend them to respectable
masters as apprentices.</p>

<p>But let us walk through the kitchen, and ascend the
short zig-zag stairs which lead us by a passage to the
school-room, where most of the boys are at work with
their slates. Very few of the little fellows are more than
thirteen years old, and some of them have been but a
short time at school; but even those who came here
totally uninstructed have made admirable progress, and
some of the writing-books containing lessons from dictation
are well worth looking at for their clean and excellent
penmanship and fair spelling; while in arithmetic
the boys who have been longest under tuition have
advanced as far as "practice." There is nothing superfluous
in school-room, work-room, or play-room&mdash;indeed,
one might almost say that they are unfurnished, except
for desks and forms and plain deal tables. The play-room
is a lower portion of the old slaughter-house,
with a high ceiling, to a beam in which is fixed a
pair of ropes terminating in two large wooden rings by
which the youthful gymnasts swing and perform all
kinds of evolutions, while a set of parallel bars are among
the few accessories.</p>

<p>It is evident that nothing is spent in mere ornament,
and that the expenditure is carefully considered, though
recreation, and healthy recreation too, is a part of the
daily duty, which is regulated in a fashion befitting the
rather military associations of the place. Even now, as
the cheery superintendent, Mr. Ramsden, who was lately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
quartermaster-sergeant of the 16th Regiment, calls
"Attention!" every boy is quickly on his feet and ready
to greet us; and what is more, the boys seem to like
this kind of discipline, for it is kind in its prompt demand
for obedience, and the regularity and order includes a
kind of self-reliance, which is a very essential part of
education for lads who must necessarily be taught what
they have to learn in a comparatively short time, and are
then sent out where order and promptitude are of the
utmost service to them. Economy is studied, but the
recollection of the cheery kitchen suggests that there is
no griping hard endeavour to curtail the rations necessary
to support health and strength. In fact, the boys
are sufficiently fed, warmly clothed, and are encouraged
both to work and play heartily. Breakfast consists of
bread and coffee; dinner of meat and vegetables three
days in the week, fish on one day (Wednesday), pudding
on Monday, soup on Friday, meat and cheese on Saturday;
tea or coffee with bread and dripping, while on
Sundays butter is an additional luxury both at breakfast
and tea; and on Thursdays and Sundays tea is substituted
for coffee at the evening meal. All the boys are
decently and warmly clothed, and though only some of
their number "take to music" as a profession, and choose
to go into the military bands, they all receive instruction.
They are taught to keep their own bunks and dormitories
neat, and, in fact, do their own household work;
while, morning and afternoon, personal trimness is promoted
by the military "inspection" which is part of the
discipline. There is half an hour's play after breakfast,
another quarter of hour before dinner, three-quarters of
an hour for "washing and play" after dinner, a quarter
of an hour before tea, and from an hour and a half to two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
hours for boot-cleaning and play before bed-time, besides
out-door exercise daily, except in wet weather, when
drill and gymnastics take its place. They also go to
Primrose Hill on Tuesday and Saturday afternoons,
there to run in the fresh air and disport themselves in
cricket, or such games as they can find the toys for, by
the kindness of the committee or generous visitors. Even
with these recreations, however, they find time to go
through a very respectable amount of work in the fourteen
hours between rising and bed-time; and the letters
received from lads who have left the school are an evidence
that they remember with pleasure and with gratitude
the Refuge that became a home, and to which they
attribute their ability to take a place which would have
been denied to them without the aid which grew out of
pity for their neglected childhood.</p>

<p>Here is a short epistle from one of the juvenile band,
at Shorncliffe Camp, written a year or two ago:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"I now take the pleasure of writing these few lines and I hope all the
 boys are all well, and all in the school and please Mr. Ramsden will
 you send me the parcel up that I took into the school it was laying in
 the bookcase in the school-room and I hope that all the boys are all
 getting on with their instruments and the snips with their work and I

<p>This is a characteristic schoolboy letter, which shows
how much boys are alike in all grades. The following is
another letter from Shorncliffe:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>There is something pleasant indeed in letters like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
these; and I for one am not surprised that the boys
should go to their musical practice with a will.</p>

<p>They are just preparing to play something for our
especial delight now, and so burst out, in a grand
triumphant blast, with "Let the Hills Resound," after
which we will take our leave, and, we hope, not without
melody in our hearts. Just one word as we go through
this kitchen again. Two West End clubs supply the
Newport Market Refuge with the remnants of their
well-stocked larders. Did it ever occur to you how
many hungry children and poor men and women could be
fed on the actual waste that goes on in hotels, clubs, inns,
dining-rooms, and large and ordinary households every
day? M. Alexis Soyer used to say that he could feed
ten thousand people with the food that was wasted in
London every day; and I am inclined to think he was
not far wrong. At all events, an enormous salvage of
humanity might be effected if only the one meal daily
which might be made of "refuse" pieces of meat and
bread, bones, cuttings of vegetables, cold potatoes, and
general pieces&mdash;was secured to the thousands to whom
"enough" would often indeed be "as good as a feast."
To people who know how much that is really good for
food&mdash;not the plate-scrapings and leavings, but sound
and useful reversions of meat and bread and vegetables,
bones, and unsightly corners of joints&mdash;is either suffered
to spoil or is thrown at once into the waste-tub, both in
hotels and private houses, the additional knowledge that
there are hungry children in every district in London to
whom a bowl of nourishing soup or a plate of minced
meat and vegetables would be a boon, may easily be
a pain, because of the inability to suggest how to
organise the means of utilising what one is tempted to
call undeserved plenty.</p>

<h2><i>FEEDING THE MULTITUDE.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_I.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I suppose</span>
there are people still to be found
who have but a vague notion of what it is to
be really hungry. They may be conscious
of possessing a good appetite now and then,
and having the means of obtaining food, and to a certain
extent of choosing what they will eat, regard being rather
"sharp set" as a luxury which gives additional zest to a
dinner, enabling them to take off the edge of their craving
with a plate of warm soup, and to consider what they
would like "to follow."</p>

<p>Of course we most of us read in the papers of the distress
of the poor during the winter, of the number of
children for whom appeals are made that they may have
a meal of meat and vegetables once or twice a week, of
the aggregate of casual paupers during a given period,
and of cases where "death accelerated by want and exposure"
is the verdict of a coroner's jury; but we do not
very easily realise what it is to be famished; have perhaps
never experienced that stage beyond hunger&mdash;beyond
even the faintness and giddiness that makes us doubt
whether we could swallow anything solid, and would
cause us to turn hopelessly from dry bread. There is no
need here to detail the sufferings that come of starvation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
They are dreadful enough; but if our charity needs the
stimulus of such descriptions we are in a bad way, and
are ourselves in danger of perishing for want of moral
sustenance.</p>

<p>Those who need assurance of the hunger of hundreds
of their poor neighbours need not go very far to obtain
it. A quarter of an hour at the window of any common
cook-shop in a "low neighbourhood," at about seven
o'clock in the evening, when the steam of unctuous
puddings is blurring the glass, and the odour of leg-of-beef
soup and pease-pudding comes in gusts to the chilly
street, should suffice. There is pretty sure to be a group
of poor little eager-eyed pinch-nosed boys and girls
peering wistfully in to watch the fortunate possessor of
two-pence who comes out with something smoking hot
on a cabbage-leaf, and begins to bite at it furtively before
he crosses the threshold.</p>

<p>Of course, according to modern social political economy,
it would be encouraging mendicity, and sapping the
foundations of an independent character, to distribute
sixpenny pieces amongst the juvenile committee of taste
who are muttering what they would buy if only somebody
could be found to advance "a copper." But it is to
be hoped or feared (which?) that a good many people
yet live who would instinctively feel in their pockets for
a stray coin to expend on a warm greasy slab of baked
or boiled, or on half a dozen squares of that peculiarly
dense pie-crust which is sold in ha'porths. This is a
vulgar detail; but somehow poverty and hunger <i>are</i>
vulgar, and we should find it difficult to get away from
them if we tried ever so hard. Even School Boards,
peeping out upon the children perishing for lack of knowledge,
find themselves in a difficulty, because there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
provision under the compulsory or any other clause for
the children who are also perishing for lack of food. The
Board beadle does not at present go about with soup-tickets
in his pockets; and for the poor shivering shoeless
urchins who are mustered in the big brick-built room
where they assemble according to law there is no free
breakfast-class.</p>

<p>It must one day become a question how they are to
learn till they are filled. Grown people find it hard
enough to fix their attention on the best advice or the
most saving doctrine while they suffer involuntary hunger.
The multitude must mostly be fed before they are taught.
Even disciples have had a revelation of the Bread of Life
in the breaking of bread that perishes. Do we still need
a miracle to teach us that?</p>

<p>Happily, efforts are made to give meat to the hungry.
During the winter weather food is distributed in various
ways amidst some of those poverty-stricken neighbourhoods
to which I am obliged to take you during our excursions;
but the demand far exceeds the supply, and
people suffer hunger at all seasons, though most of all in
the time of bleak winds and searching cold.</p>

<p>I want you to come to-day to a kitchen which is open
all the year round&mdash;the only kitchen of the kind in London
which does not close its doors even when the spring-tide
brings buds of promise on the shrubs in Leicester
Square, and the London sparrow comes out from roofs
and eaves, and preens his dingy plumage in the summer
sun, as though Great Windmill Street had something in
common with its name, and sweet country odours came
from the region of the Haymarket.</p>

<p>For, you know, we are still in the district of Soho. I
have but just now brought you out of Newport Market,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
and now we are in a very curious part of this vast strange
city. The streets are dim and dingy, but not so squalid
as you might have imagined. They are still and silent,
too, as of a neighbourhood that has seen better days, and
even in its poverty has a sense of gentility which is
neither boisterous nor obtrusive.</p>

<p>You will remember that I referred to this neighbourhood
of Soho when I spoke of those old French refugees
who came and made industrial colonies in London after
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. This is the only
really foreign quarter of London which has lasted until
to-day; but that is to be accounted for by the fact that
it became representative of no particular industry, and
that, probably from the fact of many of the patrons of
literature and art having then town houses about Leicester
and Soho Squares, the more artistic refugees took up
their abode in the adjacent streets.</p>

<p>From the time when William Hogarth painted his picture
of the Calais Gate till only a short time ago, when
refugees fled from besieged Paris to find some poor and
wretched lodging in the purlieus of Cranbourne Street,
where they might live in peace and hear their native
tongue, this has been the resort of poor foreigners in
London. It almost reminds one of some of the smaller
streets of a continental city; and as we look at the queer
shabby restaurants, and the shops with strange names
painted above them in long yellow letters, we almost expect
to find the pavement change to cobble-stones, and
to see some queer wooden sign dangle overhead, so like
is the place to the small <i>bourgeois</i> quarter that in our
earlier days lay behind the Madeleine and the Porte St.
Denis.</p>

<p>For here is an actual <i>crêmerie</i>&mdash;a queer compound of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
cook-shop and milkseller's&mdash;with a couple of bright dairy
cans outside the door, and a long loaf or two amidst the
cups and plates and sausages in the dingy window.
Over the way you see "<i>Blanchisseuse</i>" in large letters;
and next door is a <i>laiterie</i>, which differs from a <i>crêmerie</i>
as a <i>café</i> alone differs from a <i>café restaurant</i> with its
"<i>commerce de vins</i>" painted in big capitals in front of a
long row of sour-looking bottles and a green calico curtain.
It is a quaint jumble, all the way to Dean Street,
and till we reach the edge of the Haymarket&mdash;a jumble
of Brown and Lebrun, of Jones and Jean, of Robin (<i>fils</i>)
and Robinson; but for all the little musty-smelling
<i>cafés</i>, the blank bare-windowed <i>restaurants</i>, the <i>crêmeries</i>,
and the <i>boulangeries</i>, there is nothing of a well fed look
about the district, especially just at this corner, leading
as it seems to a stable-yard or the entrance to a range of
packers' warehouses. There is one open front here&mdash;is
it a farrier's or a blacksmith's shop?&mdash;where they appear
to be doing a stroke of business, however, for there is a
clinking, and a fire, and a steam; but the steam has a
fragrant odour of vegetables&mdash;of celery and turnips, of
haricots and gravy&mdash;the clink is that of basins and
spoons getting ready, and the fire is that of the boiler
which simmers two mighty cauldrons.</p>

<p>Step to the front, and you will see in big white letters
right across the house, "Mont St. Bernard Hospice."
You may well rub your eyes, for you are in the heart of
London, and stand in Ham Yard, Leicester Square, before
the soup-kitchen that is open all the year.</p>

<p>There is something very appetising in the steam that
arises from both these huge cauldrons, one of which is
the stock-pot, containing bones, remnants of joints (<i>not</i>
plate-clearings), and reversions of cold meat, &amp;c., from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
two West End clubs. To this are added vegetables&mdash;celery,
haricot beans, or barley&mdash;making it a fresh palatable
stock, not remarkable for meatiness, but still excellent
in flavour, as you may find for yourself if you join
me in a luncheon here. But the real strengthening
gravy has yet to be added, and the cauldron on the left
hand is full of it&mdash;real, genuine gravy soup, made from
raw meat and bones purchased for this purpose. As
soon as this has simmered till it is thoroughly ready, the
contents of the two cauldrons are mixed, and the result
is a delicious stew, which is ready to be turned out into
these yellow pint basins, for the hungry applicants, who
will sit down at one of these two deal tables, each of
which has its rough clean form, or to be dispensed to
those who bring jugs, bowls, cans, saucepans, kettles,
pipkins&mdash;any and almost every receptacle in which they
can carry it steaming away to their families.</p>

<p>Let us stand here and see them come in. Here is a
poor famishing fellow, who looks with eager eyes at the
savoury mess. He has evidently seen better days.
There is an unmistakable air of education about him,
and as he sits down with his basin and spoon, and the
handful of broken bread, which is added to the soup from
one of a series of clean sacks emptied for the purpose,
the superintendent, Mr. Stevens, scans him with a quick
eye, and will probably speak to him before he leaves.
There is a foreigner&mdash;an Italian, by the look of his oval
olive face&mdash;who takes his place very quietly, and as
quietly begins to eat; and yonder a famished-looking,
rough fellow, who has already devoured the basinful with
his eyes, and is evidently in sore need. Men, women,
and children, or, at all events, boys and girls, come and
present their tickets, and receive this immediate relief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
against which surely not the most rigorous opponent to
mendicancy can protest. The cadger and the professional
beggar do not go to the soup-kitchen where
nothing is charged, for they do not need food, and will
only see a ticket where it is likely to be accompanied by
the penny which will buy a quart. Be sure that there are
few cases here which are not so necessitous that they are
not far from starvation; and many of them represent
actually desperate want.</p>

<p>The tickets for obtaining this prompt relief&mdash;often only
just in time to save some poor creature from utter destitution
and crime, and as often administered when a
family is without food, and yet clings to the hope of
finding work to prevent that separation which they must
submit to by becoming paupers&mdash;are placed in the hands
of clergymen, doctors, district visitors, Bible-women, and
those who know the poor, and can feel for them when in
hard times they pawn furniture, tools, and clothes, and
suffer the extremity of want, before they will apply for
parochial relief, and have offered to them the alternative
of "going into the house."</p>

<p>The annals of the poor, from which extracts occasionally
appear in the newspapers in the accounts of coroners'
inquests, prove to what dreadful sufferings many decent
but destitute people will submit rather than become recognised
paupers; and no system of charitable relief outside
the workhouse walls will be effectual or useful which
does not recognise and respect this feeling. Who would
let the possible accident of some unworthy person getting
a gratuitous pint of soup stand in the way of a work
such as we see going on here, where one year's beneficent
action includes above ten thousand persons relieved?&mdash;a
large number of whom are temporarily taken into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
the Hospice, as we shall see presently, while a great contingent
is represented by the family tickets, which enable
poor working men and women from various districts in
London to carry away a gallon of strong nourishing soup,
and an apronful of bread to their hungry little ones.
You see that great heap of pieces of fine bread&mdash;slices,
hunches, remnants of big loaves, dry toast, French bread,
brown bread, and rolls&mdash;all placed in a clean wooden
bin, they also come from the two great West End clubs
before mentioned, and are so appreciated by the applicants
for relief (they being usually good judges of quality)
that you may note a look of disappointment if the stock
of club bread has been exhausted, and a portion of one
of the common loaves bought for the purpose is substituted.
The small broken bread in those clean sacks is
club bread also&mdash;the crumbs from rich men's tables, but
clean, and thoroughly good, fit for immediate addition to
the soup, which a hungry company of diners consume in
a painfully short space of time.</p>

<p>They are not inhabitants of this district, either; comparatively
few come from the immediate neighbourhood,
though, of course, some poor families of the adjacent
streets and alleys, and occasionally foreign workmen&mdash;many
of them adepts in artistic employments, who are
in the land of the stranger and in want&mdash;come here and
have not only the help of a meal, but the kind inquiry,
the further aid that will sustain hope, and enable them to
look for work, and find the means of living. Londoners
from Kentish Town, Lambeth, Shoreditch, and Chelsea&mdash;poor
hungry men and women from all parts of the
great city&mdash;find their way here to obtain a dinner; and
it is extremely unlikely that they would leave even the
least profitable employment and walk so far for the sake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
of a basin of soup. Food alone is offered, not money,
and there is little probability of imposition when there is
so little to be gained by the attempt. But while the
great cauldrons are being emptied, let us hear what they
do at this "Mont St. Bernard Hospice" at the Christmas
season.</p>

<p>Here is a list of good things that were sent at Christmas-tide
for a special purpose:&mdash;A noble earl sent a
sheep, if not more than one, and other generous givers in
kind&mdash;many of them manufacturers of or dealers in the
articles they contributed&mdash;forwarded loaves, biscuits,
hams, rice, flour, currants, raisins, ale, porter, cocoa, peas,
and other comfortable meats and drinks, so that there
was a glorious distribution to the poor on Christmas Eve,
when 936 families were provided with a Christmas dinner,
consisting of 4 lbs. of beef, 3 lbs. of pudding, bread, tea,
and sugar, together with such other seasonable and most
acceptable gifts as were apportioned to them in accordance
with the number of their children and the quantity of miscellaneous
eatables and drinkables available for the purpose.</p>

<p>But we have not quite done with it yet, for it is a hospice
in fact, as well as in name. Just as in the Newport
Market Refuge, the houseless and destitute are received
with little question&mdash;the homeless and friendless are
here taken in after little inquiry, even the subscriber's
ticket for admission being occasionally dispensed with,
when Mr. Stevens, the superintendent, sees an obviously
worthy case among the applicants who come to ask
for a meal. It must be remembered, however, that an
experienced eye can detect the casual very readily,
and that Mr. Stevens, who served with his friend Mr.
Ramsden, of Newport Market, when they were both in
the army, is as smart a detective as that shrewd and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
compassionate officer. It is so much the better for those
who are really deserving&mdash;so much the better even for
those who, being ashamed to dig, are not ashamed to beg&mdash;the
ne'er-do-weels who, even in the degradation of
poverty brought about by idleness and dissipation, come
down to solicit food and shelter, and find both, together
with ready help, if they will mend their ways. There
are some such, but not many: more often a man of education,
broken by misfortune, and perhaps by the loss of
a situation through failure or accident beyond his control,
finds himself starving and desolate. Such men have
come here, and found, first, food, then a lavatory, then a
bed in a good-sized room, where only seven or eight persons
are received to sleep, then a confidential talk, advice,
the introduction to people willing and able to help them
among the committee and subscribers of the Institution.</p>

<p>It may be a French tutor destitute in London, but
with his character and ability beyond doubt; it may be,
it <i>has</i> been, a young foreign artist; a skilled labourer
from the country, who has come to London to find work
and finds want instead; a poor school-teacher who,
having lost an appointment, and being unable to work
at any other calling, is in despair, and knows not where
to turn; an honest fellow, ready and willing to turn his
hand to anything, but finding nothing to which he can
turn his hand without an introduction. Such are the
cases which are received at this hospice in Ham Yard,
where they are permitted to remain for a day or two, or
even for a week or two, till they find work, or till somebody
can make inquiries about them and help them to
what they seek.</p>

<p>About seven men and eight women can be received
within the walls, but there are seldom the full number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
there, because it is necessary to discriminate carefully.
The object is to relieve immediate and painful distress,
and to give that timely aid which averts starvation by
the gift of food, and prevents the degradation of pauperism
by means of advice, assistance, and just so much
support as will give the stricken and friendless men or
women time to recover from the first stupor of hopelessness
or the dread of perishing, and at the same time
afford the opportunity of proving that they are ready
and willing to begin anew, with the consciousness that
they have not been left desolate.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></div>

<h2><i>GIVING REST TO THE WEARY.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_W.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">We</span>
have not yet done with this wonderful district
of Soho. It is one of those attractive
quarters of London, which is interesting
alike for its historical associations and for
memorable houses that were once inhabited by famous
men. In essays, letters, fiction&mdash;all through that period
which has been called the Augustan age of English
literature&mdash;we find allusions to it; and after that time
it continued to be the favourite resort of artists, men
of letters, wealthy merchants, and not a few statesmen
and eminent politicians. In Leicester Square, Hogarth
laughed, moralised, and painted. The house of
Sir Joshua Reynolds stands yet in that now renovated
space, and a well-known artist has a studio there to-day.
But the tide of fashion has receded since powdered wigs
and sedan chairs disappeared. The tall stately houses
are many of them dismantled, or are converted into
manufactories and workshops. The great iron extinguishers
which still adorn the iron railings by the doorsteps
have nearly rusted away. It must be a century
since the flambeaux carried by running footmen were
last thrust into them, when great rumbling, creaking
coaches drew up and landed visitors before the dimly-lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
portals. Silence and decay are the characteristics
of many a once goodly mansion; and the houses
themselves are not unfrequently associated with the relief
of that poverty which is everywhere so apparent as to
appeal to almost every form of charity. Before one such
house we are standing now, its quietly opening door revealing
a broad lofty hall, from which a great staircase,
with heavy baluster of black oak and panelled walls leads
to the spacious rooms above. This mansion is historical,
too, in its way, for we are at the corner of Soho Square,
in Greek Street, and are about to enter what was once the
London residence of the famous Alderman Beckford, and
his equally famous son&mdash;the man who inherited the mysterious
and gorgeously furnished palace at Fonthill, the
author of "Vathek," the half-recluse who bought Gibbon's
extensive library at Lausanne, that he might have
"something to amuse him when he went that way," and
afterwards went that way, read himself nearly blind, and
then made a friend a present of all the books, sold Fonthill,
went abroad, and set about building another mysterious
castle in a strange land.</p>

<p>In that big committee-room on the first floor, which
we shall visit presently, there was to be seen, four or five
years ago, a stupendous chimney-piece of oak, elaborately
carved, and said to have been a masterpiece of
Grinling Gibbons. It was taken down and sold for a
handsome sum of money, to augment the funds of the
Institution which now occupies the old mansion, for the
door at which we enter receives other guests than those
who once thronged it&mdash;suffering, depressed, poverty-stricken,
weary men and women, who come here to seek
the rest that is offered to them in the quiet rooms&mdash;the
restoration of meat and drink and refreshing sleep, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
comfort of hopeful words and friendly aid. It is named
"The House of Charity," and the work that its supporters
have set themselves to do is carried on so
silently&mdash;I had almost said so secretly&mdash;that the stillness
you observe within the building, as we stand here
waiting for the lady who superintends the household,
is suggestive alike of the repose which is essential to
the place, and of a severe earnestness not very easy to
define.</p>

<p>Members of the same committee, whose earnest hearty
work is apparent at Newport Market and at the Soup
Kitchen in Ham Yard, are helping this House of Charity,
which has the Archbishop of Canterbury for its patron
and the Bishop of London for its visitor.</p>

<p>Here, in the two large sitting-rooms opening from the
hall, we may see part of what is being done, in giving
rest to the weary and upholding them who are ready to
faint. One is for men, the other for women, who have
been received as inmates, for periods extending from a
fortnight to a longer time, according to the necessities of
each case, and the probability of obtaining suitable employment.
Of course the aid is intended to be only
temporary&mdash;though in some peculiar cases it is continued
till the applicant recovers from weakness following either
uninfectious illness or want. There can be, of course,
no actual sick-nursing here; but in a warm and comfortable
upper room, near the dormitory, which we shall see
presently&mdash;a room which is the day-nursery of a few
children who are also admitted&mdash;I have seen young
women, one who was suffering from a consumptive
cough, another an out-patient at an hospital for disease
of the hip, and wearing an instrument till she could be
admitted as a regular case. They were both sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
cosily at their tea, and were employed at needlework, as
most of the women are who find here a temporary home.
For it is one of the beneficent results of an influential
committee, that a number of cases are sent to hospitals
or to convalescent homes, and so are restored; but till
this can be done they are fed and tended&mdash;fed with food
more delicate than that of the ordinary meal&mdash;and are
allowed to rest in peace and to regain strength.</p>

<p>But we are still in the men's sitting-room, where
several poor fellows are looking at the lists of advertisements
in the newspapers for some announcement of
a vacant situation. A supply of books is also provided
both for men and women, and the latter are just now
engaged in mending or making their clothes.</p>

<p>Between thirty and forty inmates can be received at
one time, and those who are in search of employment, or
who require to go out during the day, may leave the house
after breakfast, and return either to dinner or to tea.
There are, indeed, few restrictions when once preliminary
inquiries and the recommendation of a member of
the committee result in the admission of an applicant;
and it is easy to see how deeply and thankfully many of
these poor depressed men and women, beaten in the
battle of life, with little hope of regaining a foothold,
weak, dispirited, destitute, and with no strength left to
struggle under the burden that weighs them down,
find help and healing, food and sleep, advice, and very
often a recommendation which places them once more in
a position of comfort and independence. A large proportion
of those who are admitted are provided with situations
either permanently or for a period long enough to
enable them to turn round the difficult corner from
poverty and dependence to useful and appropriate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
employment. Some are sent to Homes, hospitals, or
orphanages, and many return to their own homes. From
those homes they have wandered, hoping to find the
world easier than it has proved to be, and in going back
to them they have fallen by the wayside.</p>

<p>There are sometimes remarkable varieties here&mdash;emigrants
waiting for ships to sail that will bear them
to another land; men of education, such as tutors,
engineers, engravers, and professional men, who have
been unsuccessful, or have lost their position, often
through no immediate fault of their own. Of course,
the large class of genteel poverty is largely represented
in the five or six hundred cases which make the average
number of yearly inmates. Clerks, shopmen, and travellers
are about as numerous as servants, porters, and
pages. Poor women, many of whom are ladies by birth
or previous position and education, find the House of
Charity a refuge indeed, and feel that the person who
has charge of the household arrangements, as well as
those who have charge of the inmates, the accounts and
correspondence, may be appealed to with an assurance
of true sympathy. Here, beside the two sitting-rooms,
is a large room which we will call the refectory; it is
plainly furnished, with separate tables for men and
women, and the quantity and description of the food
supplied is such as would be provided in a respectable
and well-ordered family&mdash;tea or coffee and plenty of
good bread-and-butter morning and evening, meat,
bread and vegetables, for dinner, and a supper of
bread and cheese. There are no "rations," nor any
special limit as to quantity, and if one could forget the
distress which brings them hither, the family might be
regarded as belonging to some comfortable business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
establishment, with good plain meals and club-room on
each side the dining-hall for meeting in after working
hours.</p>

<p>Let us go upstairs, and look at the dormitories, which
occupy respectively the right and left side of the building,
and we shall see that they are so arranged as to
secure that privacy, the want of which would be most
repulsive to persons of superior condition. Each long
and lofty room is divided into a series of enclosures or
cabins by substantial partitions about eight feet high,
and in each of these separate rooms&mdash;all of which are
lighted by several windows or by gas-branches in the
main apartment&mdash;there is a neat comfortable bed and
bedstead, with space for a box, a seat, and a small table
or shelf.</p>

<p>A resident chaplain or warden conducts morning and
evening prayer in the chapel, which is built on part of
the open area at the back of the building; and I would
have you consider, not only that to many of these weary
souls this sacred spot may come to be associated with
that outcome to renewed life for which their presence
in the Institution gives them reason to hope, but that it
is most desirable for the invalids, who frequently form so
large a portion of the congregation, to be able to attend
worship without practically leaving the house.</p>

<p>Not only because of the sick and the physically feeble,
however, does the House of Charity represent a work
that needs vast extension.</p>

<p>The case-book would reveal a series of stories none
the less affecting because they are entered plainly, briefly,
and without waste of words. They need few touches of
art to make them painfully interesting. They tell of
ladies, wives of professional men, brought to widowhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
and sudden poverty; of men of education cast adrift
through failure or false friendship, and not knowing
where to seek bread; of children left destitute or deserted
under peculiar circumstances; of women removed
from persecution, and girls from the tainted atmosphere
of vice; of weary wanderers who, in despair of finding
such a shelter, and dreading the common lodging-house,
have spent nights in the parks; of foreigners stranded
on the shore of a strange city; of ministers of the gospel
brought low; of friendless servant-girls, ill-treated, defrauded
of their wages, or discharged almost penniless,
and cast loose amidst the whirlpool of London streets.</p>

<p>But, as I have already intimated, it is not alone for
its temporary aid in affording a home that the House of
Charity is distinguished; it affords a good hope also, by
seeking to obtain situations, for cases where peculiar circumstances
make such a search difficult&mdash;for bereaved
and impoverished ladies, and for educated men, as well
as for domestic servants and ordinary employés. Its
supporters give their special aid to the work, and, as
they number amongst them many ladies and gentlemen
of considerable social influence, employment is frequently
found for those whose misfortunes would otherwise be
almost irretrievable.</p>

hope abandon, ye who enter here," would,
as we might fancy, be an appropriate inscription
for many a wretched court and
alley in the greatest and most opulent city
in the world&mdash;a city distinguished for its claims to be regarded
as the centre of civilisation; as the exemplar of
benevolence, and of active Christianity. It is one of the
marvellous results of the vast extent of this metropolis
of England that there are whole districts of foul dwellings
crowded with a poverty-stricken population, which yet
are almost ignored, so far as public recognition of their
existence is concerned. Legislation itself does not reach
them, in the sense of compelling the strict observance of
Acts of Parliament framed and presumably enforced for
the purpose of maintaining sanitary conditions; philanthropy
almost stands appalled at the difficulty of dealing
with a chronic necessity so widely spread, a misery and
ignorance so deep and apparently impregnable; sentimentalism
sighs and turns away with a shiver, or is
touched to the extent of relieving its overcharged susceptibilities
by the comfortable expedient of the smallest
subscription to some association in the neighbourhood.
True, active, practical religion alone, of all the agencies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
that have operated in these places, gains ground inch by
inch, and at last exercises a definite and beneficial influence,
by taking hold of the hearts and consciences of
the people themselves, and working from within the area
of vice and misery, till the law of love, beginning to operate
where the law of force had no influence, a change,
gradual but sure, here a little and there a little, is effected.</p>

<p>We are continually hearing of the "dwellings of the
poor;" and can scarcely take up a newspaper without
noting the phrase, "one of the worst neighbourhoods in
London," connected with some report of crime, outrage,
or suffering; yet how few of us are really familiar with
the actual abodes of the more degraded and miserable
of our fellow-citizens! how quickly, how gladly, we dismiss
from our memory the account of an inquest where
the evidence of the cause of death of some unfortunate
man, woman, or child, without a natural share of light,
air, food, and water, reveals hideous details of want and
wretchedness, which we might witness only a few streets
off, and yet are unconscious of their nearness to us in
mere physical yards and furlongs, because they are so
far from us spiritually, in our lack of sympathy and compassion.</p>

<p>Even at the time that these lines are being written I
have before me a report of an examination by the
coroner into the circumstances attending the death of a
woman seventy years of age, who obtained a miserable
and precarious living by stay-making, and who was found
dead in the back kitchen of a house. Her death was
alleged to have been brought about by the unhealthiness
of the house in which she lived, although the landlord
was a medical officer of health for one of the metropolitan
districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
In this case the alleged landlord, who was actually a
medical officer of health, answered the charge made
against him by the statement that he had only just come
into possession of the property, and had at once set
about putting it in repair. It is to be hoped that this
was the case, and, indeed, the evidence of the sanitary
inspector went to show that it was so; but the question
remains: How is it that dwellings are permitted to
be thus overcrowded, and to become actual centres of
pestilence in the midst of entire neighbourhoods, where,
for one foul tenement to have an infamous reputation
amidst such general filth and dilapidation, it must indeed
be, as one member of the jury said this place was, "so
bad, that no gentleman would keep his dog there?"</p>

<p>Keep his dog indeed! Why I know whole rows and
congeries of intersecting courts and alleys where a country
squire would no more think of kennelling his hounds than
he would dream of stabling his horses! There has
during the past few years been a tolerably determined
stand made against the introduction of pigsties into the
back-yards of some of the hovels about Mile End and
Bethnal Green; and though cow-sheds are not altogether
abolished everywhere in close and overbuilt localities,
there are some precautions taken to diminish the sale of
infected milk by an inspection of the laystalls, and the
enforcement of lime-whiting and ventilation in the sheds.
Costermongers' donkeys are the only animals besides
dogs and cats which are commonly to be found in London
slums now, and as these can be stowed in any shanty
just outside the back door, or can be littered down in a
spare corner of a cellar, they remain, in costermongering
districts, without much opposition on the part of the
local authorities. For, after all, what can these authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
do? Under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act,
power was given to them to register all houses let out by
non-resident landlords, who were under a penalty of
forty shillings for not keeping their houses in repair, well
supplied with water, drainage clear, &amp;c. To those who
have an intimate acquaintance with the density of
population in whole acreages of London slums, there is
something almost ludicrous in these words, especially
when they are read in the light of the fact that the landlords
of such places are frequently parochial magnates or
officials who know how to make things pleasant with
subordinate sanitary inspectors.</p>

<p>What may be the ultimate result of an Act of Parliament
"for improving the dwellings of the poor" it is not
at present easy to say; but assuredly any plan which
commences by a general and imperfectly discriminative
destruction of existing houses, hovels though they may
be, will only have the effect of crowding more closely the
already f&oelig;tid and swarming tenements where, for half-a
crown a week, eight or ten people eat, live, and sleep in
a single apartment. It was only the other day, in a district
of which I shall presently speak more definitely,
that a "mission woman" was called in to the aid of a
family, consisting of a man, his wife, his wife's brother&mdash;who
was there as a lodger&mdash;and five or six children, all
of whom occupied one room, where the poor woman had
just given birth to an infant. The place was almost destitute
of furniture; beds of straw and shavings, coverlets
of old coats and such ragged clothing as could be spared;
little fire and little food. Such destitution demanded
that the "maternity box," or a suddenly-extemporised
bag of baby-clothing and blankets, should be fetched at
once; and though the mission there is a poor one, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
terrible needs to mitigate, a constant demand for personal
work and noble self-sacrifice, such cases are every-day
events, such demands always to be answered by some kind
of helpful sympathy, even though the amount of relief
afforded is necessarily small and temporary in character.</p>

<p>Not in one quarter of London alone, but dotted here and
there throughout its vastly-extending length and breadth&mdash;from
St. Pancras, and further away northward, to
Bethnal Green and all that great series of poverty-stricken
townships and colonies of casual labour, on the east;
from the terrible purlieux of Southwark, the districts
where long rows of silent houses, in interminable streets,
chill the unaccustomed wayfarer with vague apprehensions,
where "Little Hell" and the knots and tangles of that
"Thief-London" which has found a deplorable Alsatia
in the purlieux of the Borough and of Bermondsey; and
so round the metropolitan circle, westward to the neighbourhood
of aristocratic mansions and quiet suburban
retreats, where the garotter skulks and the burglar finds
refuge; further towards the centre of the town, in Westminster,
not a stone's-throw from the great legislative
assembly, which, while it debates in St. Stephen's on sanitation
and the improvement of dwellings, scarcely remembers
all that may be seen in St. Peter's, about Pye Street, and
remembers Seven Dials and St Giles's only as traditional
places, where "modern improvements" have made a
clean sweep, just as the Holborn Viaduct and the metropolitan
Railway swept away Field Lane, and the new
meat market at Smithfield put an end for ever to the
horrible selvage of Cloth Fair&mdash;and only left the legends
of Jonathan Wild's rookery and the "blood-bowl house."</p>

<p>But the very mention of these places brings the reflection
that not in outlying districts, but in the very heart of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
London, in the core of the great city itself, the canker of
misery, poverty, and vice is festering still. What is the
use of eviction, when the law punishes houselessness, and
the <i>Poor</i> Law cannot meet any sudden demand, nor
maintain any continuous claim on the part of the houseless?
Summarily to thrust a score or so of wretched
families into the streets is to make them either criminals
or paupers. They must find some place of shelter; and
if they are to live <i>by</i> their labour, they must live <i>near</i>
their labour, the wages of which are, at best, only just
sufficient to procure for them necessary food and covering
for their bodies.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood to which I have already referred,
four thousand evictions have taken place, or, at any rate,
the population has diminished from 22,000 to 18,000, because
of a small section of a large puzzle map of courts
and alleys having been taken down in order to build
great blocks of warehouses. The consequence is, that in
the remaining tangle of slums the people herd closer, and
that a large number of poor lodgers have gone to crowd
other tenements not far distant, and which were already
peopled beyond legal measure.</p>

<p>For this acreage of vice and wretchedness of which I
speak is close to the great city thoroughfares&mdash;almost
within sound of Bow Bells. It is about a quarter of a
mile in extent each way, lying between the Charterhouse
and St. Luke's, close to the new meat market at
Smithfield on one side, and Finsbury Square on the
other. One entrance to it is directly through Golden
Lane, Barbican; the other close to Bunhill Fields burial
ground, along a passage which bears the significant name
of "Chequer Alley." It is a maze of intersecting and
interlocking courts, streets, and alleys, some of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
without any thoroughfare, some reached by ascending or
descending steps, many of them mere tanks, the walls of
which are represented by hovels inhabited by costermongers,
French-polishers, dock-labourers, chair-makers,
workers at all kinds of underpaid labour and poor handicrafts.
Many of the women go out to work at factories,
or at charing, and the children are&mdash;or at least were&mdash;left
to the evil influences of the streets, till another and a
more powerful influence began to operate, slowly, but
with the impetus of faith and love, to touch even this
neglected and miserable quarter of London with "the
light that lighteth every man."</p>

<p>In this square quarter of a mile&mdash;which, starting from
the edge of Aldersgate, stretches to the further main
thoroughfare abutting on the pleasant border of the City
Road, and includes the northern end of Whitecross
Street&mdash;there are eighty public-houses and beer-shops!</p>

<p>I tell you this much, as we stand here at the entrance
of Golden Lane, but I have no intention just now to take
you on a casual visit either to the dens of wretchedness
and infamy, or to the homes where poverty abides. I
must try to let you see what has been done, and is still
doing, to bring to both that Gospel which is alone
efficient to change the conditions, by changing the hearts
and motives of men. I may well avoid any description
of the places which lie on either hand, for, in fact, there
is nothing picturesque in such misery, nothing specially
sensational in such crime. It is all of a sordid miserable
sort; all on a dreary dead-level of wretchedness and
poverty, full of poor shifts and expedients, or of mean
brutality and indifference. There is no show-place to
which you could be taken, as it is said curious gentlemen
were at one time conducted to the dens of the mendicants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
thieves, and highwaymen of old London. Even in
the tramps' kitchen the orgies, if there are any, are of so
low a kind that they would be depressing in their monotonous
degradation.</p>

<p>Let us go farther, and enter this strange wilderness by
its fitting passage of Chequer Alley, so that we may, as it
were, see the beginning of the work that has been going
on with more or less power for more than thirty years.</p>

<p>I think I have some acquaintance with what are the
worst neighbourhoods of London. I have made many a
journey down East; have studied some of the strange
varieties of life on the shore amidst the water-side population;
have lived amidst the slums of Spitalfields, and
passed nights "Whitechapel way;" but never in any unbroken
area of such extent have I seen so much that is
suggestive of utter poverty, so much privation of the
ordinary means of health and decency, as on a journey
about this district which I long ago named "The
Chequers." Each court and blind alley has the same
characteristics&mdash;the same look of utter poverty, the same
want of air and light, the same blank aspect of dingy
wall and sunken doorsteps, the same square areas surrounded
by hovels with clothes'-lines stretched from
house to house, almost unstirred by any breeze that
blows, shut in as they are in close caverns, only to be
entered by narrow passages between blank walls. It is
the extent of this one solid district, almost in the very
centre of City life, that is so bewildering, and wherein
lies its terrible distraction.</p>

<p>The labour of reformation has begun, but the labourers
are few. For more than thirty years some efforts have
been going on to redeem this neglected and unnoticed
neighbourhood, which lies so near to, and yet so far
from London's heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
Let it be noted that this moral effort had gone on for
nearly twenty-nine years before any very definite
attempt was made to improve the physical condition of
the place.</p>

<p>In 1841 a tract distributor, Miss Macarthy, began an
organised endeavour to teach the depraved inhabitants of
Chequer Alley. In 1869, a sanitary surveyor, reporting
on <i>one</i> of the courts of this foul district, recommended
that the premises there should be demolished under the
"Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act," because the
floors and ceilings were considerably out of level, some of
the walls saturated with filth and water, the others broken
and falling down, doors, window-sashes and frames
rotten, stairs dilapidated and dangerous, roof leaky and
admitting the rain, no provisions for decency, and a foul
and failing water supply.</p>

<p>The "pulling-down" remedy, without any simultaneous
building up, has been extended since then in a
locality where a model lodging-house, which has been
erected, has stood for years almost unoccupied, because
like all model lodging-houses in such neighbourhoods,
neither the provisions nor the rentals are adapted to
meet the wants and the means of the poorest, of whom,
as I have already said, a whole family cannot afford to
pay more than the rental for a single room, or two rooms
at the utmost.</p>

<p>But we are wandering away from the work that we
came to see. Look at that wistful young native, standing
there quite close to the mouth of Chequer Alley.
Ask him what is that sound of children's voices from a
casually-opened doorway, and he will tell you "It's our
school; yer kin go in, sir, if yer like&mdash;anybody kin." As
the name of the institution is "Hope Schools for All,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
his invitation is doubtless authorised, and we may well
feel that we have made a mistake in thinking of the
Italian poet's hopeless line, for out of the doorway there
comes a sound of singing, and inside the doorway is a
room containing fifty or sixty "infants," seated on low
forms, and many of them such bright, rosy&mdash;yes, rosy&mdash;clean&mdash;yes,
comparatively, if not superlatively clean&mdash;little
creatures, that hope itself springs to fresh life in
their presence. It is thirty-four years since Miss
Macarthy, with an earnest desire to initiate some work of
charity and mercy, resolved to become a distributor of
tracts, and the district she chose was this same foul
tangle to which I have asked you to accompany me.
Bad as the whole neighbourhood is now, it was worse
then. It was never what is called a thief-quarter, but
many juvenile thieves haunted it; and the men were as
ruffianly and abusive, the women as violent and evil-tongued
as any who could be found in all London.
Instead of being paved, and partially and insufficiently
drained, it was a f&oelig;tid swamp, with here and there a
pool where ducks swam, while the foul odours of the
place were suffocating. No constable dare enter far into
the maze without a companion. But the tract distributor
ventured. In the midst of an epidemic of typhus, or
what is known as "poverty" fever, she went about
among the people, and strove to fix their attention on the
message that she carried. The religious services commenced
in a rat-catcher's "front parlour," and at first the
congregation broke into the hymns with scraps and
choruses of songs. The crowd which collected outside not
only interrupted the proceedings, but threatened those
who conducted them with personal violence, and even
assaulted them, and heaped insult upon them; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
lady who had put her hand to the plough would not turn
back. In the midst of her patient and difficult work she
herself was stricken down with fever. She had visited
and tended those who were suffering. When the question
was asked what had become of her, the barbarous
people learnt that she was like to die. Perhaps this
touched the hearts of some of them, for she had begun
to live down the brutal opposition of those who could not
believe in unselfish endeavours to benefit them. She recovered,
however; and supported by others, who gave
both money and personal effort, the beneficent work
went on.</p>

<p>In this large room where the children are singing we
have an example of what has been effected. Some of
the little creatures are pale, and have that wistful look
that goes to the heart; but there are few of them that
have not clean faces, and who do not show in the scanty
little dresses some attempt at decent preparation for
meeting "the guv'ness."</p>

<p>There is a school for elder children also; and in the
ramshackle old house where the classes are held there
are appliances which mark the wide application of the
beneficent effort that has grown slowly but surely, not
only in scope, but in its quiet influence upon the people
amidst whom it was inaugurated. Yonder, in a kind of
covered yard, is a huge copper, the honoured source of
those "penny dinners," and those quarts and gallons of
soup which have been such a boon to the neighbourhood,
where food is scarce, and dear. Then there was the
Christmas dinner, at which some hundreds of little guests
were supplied with roast meat and pudding, evidences of
how much may be effected within a very small space.
Indeed, this Hope School, with its two or three rooms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
is at work day and night; for not only are the children
taught&mdash;children not eligible for those Board schools
which, unless the board itself mitigates its technical
demands, will shut up this and similar institutions before
any provision is made for transferring the children to the
care of a Government department&mdash;but there are
"mothers' meetings," sewing classes, where poor women
can obtain materials at cost price, and be taught to
make them into articles of clothing. There are also
adult classes, and Sunday evening services for those who
would never appear at church or chapel but for such an
easy transition from their poor homes to the plain neighbourly
congregation assembled there. There are evenings,
too, when lectures, dissolving views, social teas, and
pleasant friendly meetings bring the people together
with humanising influences. It becomes a very serious
question for the London School Board to consider whether,
by demanding that ragged schools such as this shall be
closed if they do not show a certain technical standard
of teaching, the means of partially feeding and clothing,
which are in such cases inseparable from instructing, shall
be destroyed.</p>

<p>But here is a youthful guide&mdash;a shambling, shock-headed
lad, with only three-quarters of a pair of shoes,
and without a cap, who is to be our guide to another
great work, on the Golden Lane side of this great zigzag,
to the "Costermongers' Mission," in fact. You may
follow him with confidence, for he is a Hope School-boy&mdash;and
that means something, even in Chequer Alley.</p>

<p>Still threading our way through those dim alleys, where
each one looks like a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, but yet may be the devious
entrance to another more foul and forbidding, we
leave the "Hope-for-All" Mission Room resounding with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
infant voices, all murmuring the simple lessons of the
day. That room is seldom empty, because of the evening
school where a large class of older pupils are taught,
reading, writing, and arithmetic; the adult class, and the
"mothers' meeting," to which poor women are invited that
they may be assisted to make garments for themselves
and their children from materials furnished for them at a
cheap rate in such quantities as their poor savings can
purchase. The visiting "Bible woman" is the chief agent
in these works of mercy, since she brings parents and
children to the school, and reports cases of severe distress
to be relieved when there are funds for the purpose. Not
only by teaching and sewing, however, are the hopeful influences
of the place supported, for, as I have said already,
in this big room the people of the district are invited
to assemble to listen to lectures, readings, and music, to
see dissolving views; and in the summer, when fields are
in their beauty and the hedge-rows are full of glory, there
is an excursion into the country for the poor, little, pallid
children, while, strangest sight of all, a real "flower
show" is, or was, held in Chequer Alley. One could
almost pity the flowers, if we had any pity to spare from
the stunted buds and blossoms of humanity who grow
pale and sicken and so often die in this foul neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But we have strange sights yet to see, so let us continue
our excursion in and out, and round and round, not
without some feeling of giddiness and sickness of heart,
through the "Pigeons"&mdash;a tavern, the passage of which
is itself a connecting link between two suspicious-looking
courts&mdash;round by beershops all blank and beetling, and
silent; past low-browed doorways and dim-curtained
windows of tramps' kitchens, and the abodes of more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
poverty, misery, and it may be crime, than you will find
within a similar space in any neighbourhood in London,
or out of it, except perhaps in about five streets "down
East," or in certain dens of Liverpool and Manchester.</p>

<p>One moment. You see where a great sudden gap
appears to have been made on one side of Golden Lane.
That gap represents houses pulled down to erect great
blocks of building for warehouses or factories, and it also
represents the space in which above 4,000 people lived
when the population of this square quarter of mile of
poverty and dirt was 22,000 souls. This will give you
some idea of the consequences of making what are called
"clean sweeps," by demolishing whole neighbourhoods
before other dwellings are provided for the evicted
tenants. One result of this method of improving the
dwellings of the poor is that the people crowd closer,
either in their own or in some adjacent neighbourhood,
where rents are low and landlords are not particular how
many inmates lodge in a single room. Remember that
whole families can only earn just enough to keep them
from starving, and cannot afford to pay more than half-a-crown
or three-and-sixpence a week for rent. They
must live near their work, or they lose time, and time
means pence, and pence represent the difference between
eating and fasting.</p>

<p>"The model lodging-house!" See, there is one, and it
is nearly empty. How should it be otherwise? The
proprietors of such places, whether they be philanthropists
or speculators&mdash;and they are not likely to be
the latter&mdash;can never see a return of any profitable percentage
on their outlay while they enforce necessary
sanitary laws. The top-rooms are half-a-crown a week
each, and the lower "sets" range from about six shillings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
for two to eight-and-sixpence for three rooms. The consequence
is that the few tenants in this particular building
are frequently changing their quarters. Some of them
try it, and fall into arrear, and are ejected, or want to
introduce whole families into a single room, as they do
in these surrounding courts and alleys, and this, of
course, is not permitted. Imagine one vast building
crowded at the same rate as some of these two-storeyed
houses are! Ask the missionary, whose duty takes her
up scores of creaking staircases, to places where eight or
ten human beings eat, drink, sleep, and even work, in
one small room&mdash;where father, mother, children, and
sometimes also a brother or sister-in-law, herd together,
that they may live on the common earnings; places
where children are born, and men, women, and children
die; and the new-born babe must be clothed by the aid
of the "maternity box," and the dead must be buried by
the help of money advanced to pay for the plainest
decent funeral.</p>

<p>I do not propose to take you to any of these sights.
You could do little good unless you became familiar with
them, and entered into the work of visitation. Even in the
published reports of the organisation to which we are
now going, the "cases" are not dwelt upon, only one or
two are given from the experiences of the missionary,
and she speaks of them simply as examples of the kind
of destitution which characterises a district where deplorable
poverty is the result sometimes of drink, or what,
for want of a word applicable to the saving of pence, is
termed improvidence; but frequently also, because of sickness,
and the want even of poorly-paid employment. "In
such cases," says the report, "almost everything is parted
with to procure food and shelter <i>outside</i> the workhouse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
One of the two "ordinary" cases referred to was that
of a poor woman who was "found lying on a sack of
shavings on the floor, with an infant two days old; also
a child lying dead from fever, and two other children
crying for food. None had more than a solitary garment
on. The smell of the room was such that the missionary
was quite overcome until she had opened the window.
Clean linen was obtained, and their temporal and spiritual
wants at once looked after." This was in the Report of
above a year ago; but cases only just less distressing
occur daily still. This foul and neglected district, which
lies like an ulcer upon the great opulent city, the
centre of civilization and benevolence, seems to be as far
from us as though it were a part of some savage or semi-heathen
land under British influence. Indeed, in the
latter case, there would be a probability of more earnest
effort on behalf of the benighted people, on whose behalf
meetings would perhaps be held, and a committee of
inquiry and distribution appointed. Still, let us be
thankful that something is done. Twenty-nine poor
mothers have had the benefit of the maternity fund and
clothing, the Report tells us. "They are very grateful
for this assistance in their terrible need. Frequently the
distress is so great that two changes of clothing are given
to mother and babe, or they would be almost entirely
denuded when the time arrived for returning the boxes.
Our lady subscribers at a distance may be glad to know
that blankets, sheets, flannel petticoats, warm shawls, and
babies' clothing will always be acceptable." Thus writes
Mrs. Orsman on the subject, for the mission is known as
the Golden Lane Mission, and more popularly as "Mr.
Orsman's Mission to the Costermongers." Perhaps these
words scarcely denote the scope of the work; but costermongers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
must be taken as a representative term in a
district where, in an area of a square quarter of a
mile, there are, or recently were, eighty public-houses
and beershops, and a dense mass of inhabitants, including
street-traders or hucksters, labourers, charwomen, road-sweepers,
drovers, French polishers, artificial flower-makers,
toy-makers, with what is now a compact and
really representative body of costermongers, working
earnestly enough to keep to the right way, and, as they
always did, forming a somewhat distinctive part of the
population.</p>

<p>Sixteen years ago, Mr. Orsman began the work of
endeavouring to carry the gospel to the rough-and-ready
savages of this benighted field for missionary enterprise.
He held an official appointment, and this was his business
"after office hours." About the results of his own labour
he and his Reports are modestly reticent, but at all
events it began to bear fruit. Others joined in it; a
regular mission was established, and, with vigorous
growth, shot out several branches, so wisely uniting what
may be called the secular or temporal with the spiritual
and religious interest, that the Bread of Life was not
altogether separated from that need for the bread which
perishes. These branches are full of sap to-day, and one
of them is also full of promising buds and blossoms, if
we are to judge of the rows of ragged&mdash;but not unhappy&mdash;urchins
who fill this large room or hall of the Mission-house.</p>

<p>It is only the first-floor of two ordinary houses knocked
into one, but a great work is going on. The parochial
school was once held here, and now the room is full of
children who might still be untaught but for the effort
which made the Ragged School a first consideration in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
an endeavour to redeem the whole social life of the district.
Wisely enough, the School Board accepted the aid
which this free day-school for ragged and nearly destitute
children affords to a class which the Education Act
has not yet taught us how to teach.</p>

<p>In four years, out of ninety-five boys and girls who
entered situations from this school, only one was dismissed
for dishonesty, and it was afterwards found that
he was the dupe of the foreman of the place at which he
worked.</p>

<p>Well may Mr. Harwood, the school superintendent,
be glad in the labour that he has learnt to love in spite of
all the sordid surroundings. There is life in the midst
of these dim courts&mdash;a ragged-school and a church,
which is poor, but not, strictly speaking, ragged. In fact,
"the patching class" for ragged boys, which meets on
Thursdays, from five to seven in the afternoon, remedies
even the tattered garments of the poor little fellows, who,
having only one suit, must take off their habiliments in
order to mend them. Occasional gifts of second-hand
clothes are amongst the most useful stock of the schoolmaster,
as anybody may believe who sees the long rows
of children, many of them, like our juvenile guide, with
two odd boots, which are mere flaps of leather, and attire
which it would be exaggeration to call a jacket and
trousers.</p>

<p>The school-room is also the church and the lecture-hall.
It will hold 300 people; and the Sunday-evening
congregation fills it thoroughly, while, on week-nights,
special services, and frequently lectures, entertainments,
and attractive social gatherings bring the costers and
their friends in great force.</p>

<p>The chief of the costermongers is the Earl of Shaftesbury;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
and here, standing as it were at livery in a quiet
corner of a shanty close to the coal-shed, is the earl's
barrow, emblazoned with his crest. This remarkable vehicle,
and a donkey complimentarily named the "Earl,"
which took a prize at a Golden Lane donkey show, designate
his lordship as president of the "Barrow Club," a
flourishing institution, intended to supersede the usurious
barrow-lenders, who once let out these necessary adjuncts
to the costermongering business at a tremendous hire.
Now the proprietors of the barrows, going on the hire
and ultimate purchase-system, are prospering greatly.
There are free evening classes, mothers' meetings, a free
lending library, a free singing class, a penny savings
bank, dinners to destitute children, numbering more than
10,000 a year, a soup-kitchen, tea-meetings, and other
agencies, all of which are kept going morning, noon, and
night, within the narrow limits of these two houses made
into one. It is here, too, that the annual meeting is held,
an account of which every year filters through the newspapers
to the outer world&mdash;"The Costermongers' Annual
Tea-Party." The records of this united and earnest
assembly have been so recently given to the public, that
I need not repeat them to you as we stand here in the
lower rooms, whence the big cakes, the basins of tea, the
huge sandwiches of bread and beef, were conveyed to
the 200 guests. But as we depart, after shaking Mr.
Harwood by the hand, let me remind you that it has
been by the hearty, human, living influence of religion
that these results have been effected. The stones of
scientific or secular controversy have not been offered
instead of food spiritual and temporal. The mission-hall
has been made the centre; and from it has spread
various healing, purifying, ameliorating influences. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
this we may well take a lesson for the benefit of another
organised effort which appeals to us for help&mdash;that of
the London City Mission. This institution is trying to
effect for various districts and several classes of the poor
and ignorant in and about London that introduction of
religious teaching which Mr. Orsman began with amongst
the costermongers and others in the benighted locality
where now a clear light has begun to shine.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the promoters of the City Mission
work, held at the Mansion House, it was stated that
the 427 missionaries then employed by the society were
chosen without distinction, except that of fitness for the
office, from Churchmen, Presbyterians, Congregationalists,
Wesleyans, and Baptists, while the examining and
appointing committee were composed of thirteen clergymen
of the Established Church and thirteen Dissenting
ministers.</p>

<p>Anybody who is accustomed to visit the worst neighbourhoods
of London will know that these missionaries
go where the regular clergy cannot easily penetrate, and
where even the parish doctor seldom lingers. Every
missionary visits once a month about 500 families, or
2,000 persons. They read the Scriptures, exhort their
listeners, hold prayer and Bible meetings, distribute
copies of the Scriptures, see that children go to school,
address the poor in rooms when they cannot persuade
them to go to church, visit and pray with the dying,
lend books, hold open-air services, endeavour to reclaim
drunkards (1,546 were so restored during the last year),
admonish and frequently reclaim the vicious, raise the
fallen, and place them in asylums or induce them to
return to their homes, and work constantly for the great
harvest of God to which they are appointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
Then there are special missionaries appointed to visit
bakers, cabmen, drovers, omnibus men, soldiers, sailors,
and foreigners of various countries. They also go to
tanneries, the docks, workhouses, hospitals, and other
places; and there is a vast harvest yet, without a sickle
to reap even a single sheaf. When will the time come,
that, to the means for carrying the sustaining comfort of
the Word to men's souls, will be added some means of
helping them to realise it by such temporal aid as will
raise them from the want which paralyses and the degradation
which benumbs?</p>

<h2><i>GIVING THE FEEBLE STRENGTH.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_I.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I have</span>
had occasion lately to take you with
me to some of the worst "parts of London."
The phrase has become so common, that
there is some difficulty in deciding what it
means; and we are obliged to come to the conclusion,
that in every quarter of this great metropolis, large and
lofty buildings, splendid mansions, gorgeous shops, and
even stately palaces, are but symbols of the partial and
imperfect development of true national greatness, and
can scarcely be regarded as complete evidences of
genuine civilisation, if by that word we are to mean more
than was expressed by it in heathen times, and amidst
pagan people. Perhaps there is no more terrible reflection,
amidst all the pomp and magnificence, the vast
commercial enterprise and constantly accumulating
wealth of this mighty city, than that here we may also
find the extremes of want and misery, of vice and poverty,
of ignorance and suffering. Side by side with all that
makes material greatness&mdash;riches, learning, luxury, extravagance&mdash;are
examples of the deepest necessity and
degradation. "The rich and the poor" do indeed
"meet together" in a very sad sense. It would be well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
if the former would complete the text for themselves,
and take its meaning deep into their hearts.</p>

<p>There is reason for devout thankfulness, however, that
here and there amidst the abodes of rich and poor alike,
some building with special characteristics may be seen;
that not only the church but the charity which represents
practical religion does make vigorous protest against the
merely selfish heaping-up of riches without regard to the
cry of the poor. There are few neighbourhoods in which a
Refuge for the homeless, a soup-kitchen, a ragged-school,
a "servants home," an orphanage, a hospital or some
asylum for the sick and suffering, does not relieve that
sense of neglect and indifference which is the first painful
impression of the thoughtful visitor to those "worst
quarters," which yet lie close behind the grand thoroughfares
and splendid edifices that distinguish aristocratic
and commercial London.</p>

<p>I have said enough for the present about those poverty-haunted
districts of Shoreditch, Spitalfields, and Bethnal
Green, to warrant me in taking you through them
without further comment than suffices to call your attention
to the poorly-paid industries, the want and suffering,
and the too frequent neglect of the means of health and
cleanliness which unhappily distinguish them and the surrounding
neighbourhoods lying eastward. The weaver's
colony can now scarcely be said to survive the changes
wrought by the removal of an entire industry from Spitalfields
to provincial manufactories, and the vast importations
of foreign silks, and yet there is in this part of
London a great population of workers at callings which
are scarcely better paid than silk weaving had come to
be, previous to its comparative disappearance.</p>

<p>Marvellous changes have been effected in the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
buildings and improvements during the last thirty years,
but much of the poverty and sickness that belonged to
these neighbourhoods remain. The looms may be silent
in the upper workshops with their wide leaden casements,
but the labour by which the people live seldom brings
higher wages than suffice for mere subsistence. The
great building in which treasures of art and science are
collected is suggestive of some kind of recognition of the
need of the inhabitants for rational recreation and instruction,
and what is perhaps more to the purpose, it is
also a recognition of their desire for both; but it cannot
be denied that the recognition has come late, and has
not been completely accompanied by those provisions
for personal comfort, health, and decency, which a
stringent application of existing laws might long ago
have ensured in neighbourhoods that for years were
suffered to remain centres of pestilence.</p>

<p>The greatest change ever effected in this quarter of
London was that which followed the formation of
Victoria Park. That magnificent area, with its lakes and
islands, its glorious flower-beds and plantations, its
cricket-ground and great expanse of open field, made
Bethnal Green famous. There had always been a fine
stretch of open country beyond what was known as "the
Green," on which the building of the Museum now
stands. A roadway between banks and hedges skirting
wide fields led to the open space where a queer old
mansion could be seen amidst a few tall trees, while
beyond this again, across the canal bridge, were certain
country hostelries, one of them with what was, in that
day, a famous "tea-garden;" and, farther on, a few
farms and some large old-fashioned private residences
stood amidst meadows, gardens, and cattle pastures, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
either side of the winding road leading away to the
Hackney Marshes and the low-lying fields beyond the
old village of Homerton. It was on a large portion of
this rural area that Victoria Park was founded. Tavern
and farmhouse disappeared; the canal bridge was made
ornamental; and just beyond the queer old mansion that
stood by the roadway, the great stone and iron gates of
"the people's pleasure-ground" were erected.</p>

<p>Now, the mansion, to which I have already twice
referred, was in fact one of the few romantic buildings
of the district, for it was what remained of the house of
the persecuting Bishop Bonner, and the four most prominent
of the tall trees&mdash;those having an oblong or pit
excavation of the soil at the foot of each&mdash;were traditionally
the landmarks of the martyrdom of four sisters
who were there burnt at the stake and buried in graves
indicated by the hollows in the ground, which popular
superstition had declared could never be filled up.</p>

<p>That they have been filled up long ago, and that on
the site of the ancient house itself another great building
has been erected, you may see to-day as we stand at the
end of the long road leading to the entrance of "the
people's park."</p>

<p>The abode of cruelty and bigotry has been replaced
by one of the most truly representative of all our benevolent
institutions. The graves of the martyred sisters
might well take a new meaning if the spot could now be
discovered in the broad and beautifully planted garden,
where feeble men and women sun themselves into returning
life and strength amidst the gentle summer air
blowing straight across from the broad woods of Epping
and Hainault miles away.</p>

<p>The people's playground is fitly consummated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
people's hospital. That the City of London Hospital for
Diseases of the Chest, Victoria Park, might well be called
"the people's," is shown, not because it is supported by
state aid or by charitable endowment, on the contrary, it
depends entirely on those voluntary contributions and
subscriptions which have hitherto enabled it successfully
to carry on a noble work, but yet have only just sufficed
to supply its needs, "from hand to mouth." Yet it is
essentially devoted to patients who belong to the working
population. Like the park itself it attracts crowds of
visitors, not only from the City, from Bethnal Green,
Mile End, Poplar, Islington, Camden Town, and other
parts of London, but even from distant places whence
excursionists come to see and to enjoy it. This hospital
receives patients from every part of London, and even
from distant country places. There were seven inmates
from York last year, as well as some from Somerset,
Hereford, Derby, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Norfolk,
Suffolk, Huntingdon, Northampton, Wiltshire, and other
counties; so that in fact the districts of Bethnal Green,
Spitalfields, and Shoreditch, represented only a very
small proportion of the 781 in-patients and the 13,937
out-patients, who were admitted to medical treatment
during the twelve months. More than this, however,
amongst the contributions which are made for the
support of this hospital, there must be reckoned those
collected by working men of the district in their clubs
and associations, in token of the appreciation of benefits
bestowed by such an institution to failing men and
women, wives and shopmates and relatives, who being
threatened or actually stricken down with one of those
diseases which sap the life and leave the body prostrate,
require prompt skill and medical aid, even if they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
not in absolute need of nourishing food and alleviating
rest.</p>

<p>Standing here, in front of this broad noble building, with
its many windows, its picturesque front of red brick and
white stone, its central tower, its sheltered garden-walks,
and pleasant lawn, we may well feel glad to hear that
the work done within its wards is known and recognised.
What a work it is can only be estimated by those who
remember how fell is the disease from which so many of
the patients suffer, and how great a thing it has been,
even where cures could not be effected, usefully to prolong
the lives of hundreds of those who must have died
but for timely aid. Nay, even at the least, the alleviation
of suffering to those on whom death had already
laid his hand has been no small thing; and when we
know that of 240,000 out-patients who have received
advice and medicines, and 10,400 in-patients whose
cases have warranted their admission to the wards, a
large number of actual cures have been effected since the
establishment of this hospital, we are entitled to regard
the institution as one of the most useful that we have
ever visited together.</p>

<p>Let us enter, not by the handsome broad portico in the
centre of the building, but at the out-patients' door, in
order that we may see the two waiting-rooms, where
men and women bring their letters of admission, or attend
to see one of the three consulting physicians. Of these
three gentlemen the senior is Dr. Peacock, of whom it
may be said that he is the organiser of the hospital, the
efficiency of which is mainly due to his direction. This
is no small praise, I am aware, but there are so many
evidences of thorough unity and completeness in all
the details of management that, considering how great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
a variety of cases are included under "diseases of the
chest," from the slow insidious but fatal ravages of consumption
to the sudden pang and deadly spasm of heart
disease, and the various affections of throat and lungs,
it may easily be seen how much depends upon the adoption
of a system initiated by long study and experience.
The perfect arrangements which distinguish this hospital
are doubtless rendered easier by ample space and admirable
appliances. Plenty of room and plenty of air (air,
however, which has been warmed to one even temperature
before it enters the wards and corridors where the
patients eat and drink, sleep and walk) are the first
characteristics of the place, while a certain chaste simplicity
of ornament, and yet an avoidance of mere utilitarian
bareness, is to be observed in all that portion of
the structure where decoration may naturally be expected.</p>

<p>The board-room, the secretary's room, and the various
apartments devoted to the resident officers on the ground-floor,
are plain enough, however, though they are of good
size and proportions, the only really ornamental article
of furniture in the board-room being a handsome semi-grand
piano, the gift of one of the committee. This is a
real boon to such of the patients as can come to practise
choral singing, as well as to those who can listen delightedly
to the amateur concerts that are periodically performed,
either in the hospital itself or in one of the wards.
For they have cheerful entertainments in this resort of
the feeble, where, to tell the truth, food is often the best
physic, and sympathy and encouragement the most
potent alleviations.</p>

<p>As to the actual physic&mdash;the employment of medicines&mdash;it
is only in some of the large endowed hospitals that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
we can see such a dispensary as this spacious room,
with its surrounding rows of bottles and drawers, its two
open windows, one communicating with the men's and
the other with the women's waiting room, its slabs, and
scales and measures, on a central counter, where 380 prescriptions
will have to be made up to-day before the alert
and intelligent gentleman and his assistants who have
the control of this department, will be able to replace the
current stock out of the medical stores.</p>

<p>These small cisterns, each with its tap, occupying so
prominent a place on the counter, represent the staple
medicine of the establishment, pure cod-liver oil, of which
1,200 gallons are used every year, and they are constantly
replenished from three large cylinders, or vats,
containing 800 gallons, which occupy a room of their own
adjoining the dispensary and the compounding room, the
latter being the place where drugs are prepared, and the
great art of pill-making is practised on a remarkable
scale.</p>

<p>Continuing our walk round the hospital, we come to
the consulting-rooms, where the physicians attend daily
at two o'clock, each to see his own patients, and the reception-room,
where an officer takes the letters of introduction,
and exchanges them for attendance cards. This
is the door of the museum; and though we shall be
admitted, if you choose to accompany me, it is, like other
surgical museums, of professional more than general interest,
and not a public portion of the hospital. Turning
into the great main corridor, with its peculiar honeycombed
red-brick ceiling and pleasant sense of light and
air, we will ascend the broad staircase to the wards, those
of the women being on the first floor, while the men
occupy a precisely similar ward on the second. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
wards consist of a series of rooms of from two to six,
eight, and twelve beds each, so as to afford opportunity
for the proper classification of the cases. A day-room is
also provided for each set of wards, so that those patients
who are well enough to leave their beds may take their
meals there, or may read, play at chess, draughts, or
bagatelle, or occupy themselves with needlework. These
wards and their day-rooms all open into a light cheerful
corridor, with large windows, where the inmates may walk
and talk, or read and rest, sitting or reclining upon the
couches and settees that are placed at intervals along the
wall. All through these rooms and corridors the air is
kept at a medium temperature of from fifty-five to sixty
degrees, by means of hot-air or hot-water apparatus,
the latter being in use as well as the former. You
noticed, as we stood in the grounds, a large square structure
of a monumental character;&mdash;that was in fact the
chamber through the sides of which draughts of air are
carried to channels beneath the building, there they are
drawn around a furnace, to be heated, and to escape
through pipes that are grouped about the entire building.
In order to ensure the necessary comfort of patients
requiring a higher temperature, each ward is provided
with an open fire-place.</p>

<p>It is now just dinner-time. The ample rations of meat
and vegetables, fish and milk, and the various "special
diets," are coming up on the lift from the kitchens, and in
the women's day-room a very comfortable party is just
sitting down to the mid-day meal. Here, as elsewhere,
greater patience and more genuine cheerfulness are to be
observed among the women, than is as a rule displayed
by the men, and there are not wanting signs of pleasant
progress towards recovery, of grateful appreciation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
benefits received, and of a hopeful trusting spirit, which
goes far to aid the doctor and the nurse. There are, of
course, some sad sights. Looking into the wards, we
may see more than one woman for whom only a few
hours of this mortal life remain; more than one child
whose emaciated form and face looks as though death
itself could bring no great change. Yet it must be remembered
that cases likely soon to terminate fatally are
not admitted. The severity of the diseases and their
frequently fatal character under any condition will
account for the large proportion of sickness unto death
which finds here alleviation but not absolute cure;
though, of course, the sufferers from heart disease, who
are on the whole the most cheerful, as well as those whose
affections of the lungs can be sensibly arrested, if not
altogether healed, are frequently restored to many years
of useful work in the world. On this second storey, in
the men's ward, there are some very serious cases, and
some sights that have a heartache in them; yet they are
full of significance, for many of them include the spectacle
of God's sweet gift of trust and patience&mdash;the
mighty courage of a quiet mind. Yonder is a courageous
fellow, who, suffering from a terrible aneurism, had to
cease his daily labour, and now lies on his back, hopeful
of cure, with a set still face and a determined yet wistful
look at the resident medical officer, or the nurse who
adjusts the india-rubber ice-bag on his chest. Here,
near the door, is that which should make us bow our
heads low before the greatest mystery of mortal life.
Not the mystery of death, but the mystery of meeting
death and awaiting it. A brave, patient, noble man is
sitting up in that bed, his high forehead, fair falling hair,
long tawny beard, and steady placid eye, reminding one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
of some picture of Norseman or Viking. Lean and
gaunt enough in frame, his long thin hand is little but
skin and bone, but it is clasped gently by the sorrowing
wife, who sits beside him, and glances at us through
tearful eyes as we enter. One can almost believe that
the sick man who is going on the great journey whither
he cannot yet take the wife who loves him, has been
speaking of it calmly, there is such an inscrutable look of
absolute repose in that face. He is a Dane, and the
doctor tells us has borne his illness and great pain
with a quiet courage that has challenged the admiration
of those about him&mdash;a courage born of simple
faith, let us believe, a calm resting on an eternal foundation
of peace. Here, in the corridor, is a party, some of
its members still very weak and languid, who, having just
dined, are about to take the afternoon lounge, with book
or newspaper, and, leaving them, we will conclude our
visit by descending to the basement, whence the chief
medicine comes in the shape of wholesome nourishing
food, of meat and fish, of pure farina, of wine, and milk,
and fresh eggs, of clean pure linen, and even of ice, for
ice is a large ingredient here, and several tons are consumed
every year. The domestic staff have their apartments
in this basement portion of the building, another
division of which is occupied by the kitchens and storerooms,
while lifts for coal and daily meals and every
other requisite, ascend to the upper wards, and shoots or
wells from the upper floors convey linen and bedding
that require washing, as well as the dust and refuse of
the wards, to special receptacles.</p>

<p>The kitchen itself is a sight worth seeing with its wide
open range, where prime joints are roasting, or have been
roasted, and are now being cut into great platefuls for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
the ordinary full-diet patients. In the great boilers and
ovens, vegetables and boiled meats, farinaceous puddings,
rice, tapioca, fish, and a dozen other articles of pure diet
are being prepared, while a reservoir of strong beef-tea
represents the nourishment of those feeble ones to whom
liquid, representing either meat or milk, is all that can be
permitted. We have little time to remain in the separate
rooms, which are cool tile-lined larders, where bread and
milk and meat are kept, but among the records of donations
and contributions to the hospital it is very pleasant
to read of the multifarious gifts of food and other comforts
sent from time to time by benevolent friends.
They consist of baskets of game, fruits, rice, tea, flour,
books, warm clothing for poor patients leaving the hospital,
prints, pictures, fern-cases, all kinds of useful articles,
showing how thoughtful the donors are, of what will be a
solace and a comfort to the patients, while not the least
practically valuable remittances are bundles of old linen.
Still more touching, however, are the records of gifts
brought by patients themselves, or by their friends.</p>

<p>"I was a patient here four years ago," says a man who
has made his way to the secretary's room, "and I made
up my mind that if ever I could scrape a guinea together
I should bring it, and now I have, and here it is, if you'll
be so good as to take it, for I want to show I'm truly
grateful."</p>

<p>"If you'll please accept it from us; my husband and
I have put by fifteen shillings, and want to give it to the
hospital for your kindness to our son, who was here
before he died."</p>

<p>These are the chronicles that show this to be a people's
hospital indeed, and that should open the hearts of those
who can take pounds instead of shillings. In such cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
the secretary has ventured to remind the grateful donors
that they may be unable to afford to leave their savings,
but the evident pain, even of the hint of refusal, was
reason for accepting the poor offering. Poor, did I say?
nay, rich&mdash;rich in all that can really give value to such
gifts, the wealth of the heart that must be satisfied by
giving.</p>

<p>There is one more adjunct to this great human conservatory
which we must see before we leave. Down four
shallow stone steps from the corridor, and along a cheerful
quiet sub-corridor, is the chapel. A very beautiful
building, with no stained glass or sumptuous detail of
ornament, and yet so admirable in its simple architectural
decoration and perfect proportions, that it is an
example of what such a place should be. It is capable
of seating three or four hundred persons, and visitors are
freely admitted to the Sunday services when there is
room, though of course seats are reserved for the patients,
who have "elbows" provided in their pews, that they
may be able to lean without undue fatigue. The chapel
itself was a gift of a beneficent friend, and was presented
anonymously. One day an architect waited on the committee,
and simply said that if they would permit a
chapel to be erected on a vacant space in their grounds,
close to the main building, he had plans for such a structure
with him, and the whole cost would be defrayed by a
client of his, who, however, would not make known his
name. The gift was accepted, and the benevolent contract
nobly fulfilled. I should be glad to hear that some
other charitable donor had sent in like manner an offer
of funds to fill those two great vacant wards which, waiting
for patients, are among the saddest sights in this
hospital.</p>

<h2><i>HEALING THE SICK.</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_A.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Amidst</span>
the numerous great charities which
distinguish this vast metropolis, hospitals
must always hold a prominent if not preeminent
place. Helpless infancy, the weakness
and infirmity of old age, and prostration by sudden
accident, or the ravages of disease, are the conditions
that necessarily appeal to humanity. The latter especially
is so probable an occurrence to any of us, that we
are at once impressed by the necessity for providing
some means for its alleviation. Helpless childhood has
passed, old age may seem to be in too dim a future to
challenge our immediate attention; but sickness, sudden
disaster, who shall be able to guard against these, in a
world where the strongest are often smitten down in the
full tide of apparent health; where, in the streets
alone, fatal accidents are reckoned monthly as a special
item in Registrars' returns, and injuries amount annually
to hundreds?</p>

<p>The great endowed hospitals, therefore, those magnificent
monuments of charity which have distinguished
London for so many years, and the value of which in extending
the science of medicine can scarcely be overrated,
are regarded by us all with veneration. At the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
time we ought to feel a certain thrill of pleasure, a
satisfaction not far removed from keen emotion, when we
see inscribed on the front of some building, large or
small, where the work of healing is being carried on,
the words, "Supported by Voluntary Contributions."
One other condition, too, seems necessary to the complete
recognition of such a charity as having attained to the
full measure of a truly beneficent work&mdash;admission to it
should be free: free not only from any demand for
money payments, but untrammelled by the necessity for
seeking, often with much suffering and delay, a governor's
order or letter, by which alone a patient can be received
in many of our otherwise admirable and useful institutions
for the sick. It should be remembered that immediate
aid is of the utmost importance in the effort to heal
the sick, and that delays, proverbially dangerous, are in
such cases cruel, often fatal, always damaging to the sense
of true beneficence, of the extension of help because of the
<i>need</i> rather than for the sake of any particular influence.
It would seem that we have no right to hesitate, or to
insist on the observance of certain forms, before succouring
the grievously sick and wounded, any more than we
have to withhold food from the starving till ceremonial
inquiries are answered, and certificates of character
obtained. There are cases of poverty, and even of
suffering, where inquiry before ultimate and continued
relief may be useful, and personal influence may be necessary,
but extreme hunger and nakedness, cold and
houselessness, sudden injury or maiming, the pain of
disease, the deep and touching need of the sick and
helpless, are not such. Prompt and effectual measures
for relief, and, if necessary, admission to the place
where that relief can alone be afforded, will be the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
means of completely meeting these wants. Free hospitals,
freer even than workhouses, are what we need, and I am
about to visit one of them to-day which rejoices in its
name, "The Royal Free Hospital," now in its forty-seventh
year of useful and, I am glad to say, of vigorous
life.</p>

<p>To anyone acquainted with that strange neighbourhood
which is represented by Gray's Inn Lane and all the
queer jumble of courts and alleys that seem to shrink
behind the shelter of the broad thoroughfare of Holborn,
there is something consistent in the establishment of
such a noble charity as this hospital in Gray's Inn Road.
Its very position seems to indicate the nature and extent
of its duties. Near the homes of poverty, the streets
where people live who cannot go far to seek aid in
their extremest need, it receives those who, breaking
down through sudden disease, or requiring medical and
surgical skill to relieve the pain and weakness of recurrent
malady, have no resource but this to enable them
to fulfil their one great desire "to get back to work."
The causes of much of the sickness which sends patients
thither may be preventable: they may be found in foul
dwellings, impure water, insufficient clothing, want of
proper food, alternate hunger and intemperance; but
whatever may be its occasion, a remedy must be found
for it. Till all that is preventable <i>is</i> prevented, the consequences
will have to be mitigated, the fatal results
averted where it is possible; and when boards of health
and sanitary measures have done, there will still be sick
men to heal, failing children to strengthen, weak and
wasting women to restore.</p>

<p>It is well, then, that this Institution should stand as a
landmark of that free charity which takes help where it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
is needed most; and this qualification is the more obvious
when we turn from the sick wards to the accident
wards, and remember that three great railway termini
are close at hand, and others not far off; that all round
that teeming neighbourhood men, women, and even
children, are working at poor handicrafts, which render
them liable to frequent injuries, and that in the crowded
streets themselves&mdash;from the great busy thoroughfare
of Holborn, to the bustle and confusion of the approaches
to the stations at King's Cross&mdash;there is constant peril
to life and limb.</p>

<p>There is something so remarkable in the external
appearance of the building, such a military look about
its bold front, such a suggestion of a cavalry yard about
the broad open area behind this tall wooden entrance
gate, that you begin to wonder how such a style of
architecture should have been adopted for a hospital.
The truth is that like many&mdash;nay, like most of our
noblest work&mdash;this great provision for healing the sick
began by not waiting for full-blown opportunities. The
need was there, and the means that came to hand were
used to meet it. This building was originally the barracks
of that loyal and efficient regiment, the "Light
Horse Volunteers," and so excellently had those gallant
defenders of king and constitution provided for their
own comfort and security, that when in 1842 the premises
were vacant, and the lease for sale, the governors of the
Royal Free Hospital became the purchasers, the long
rooms were easily turned into ample, cheerful, and well-ventilated
wards, and the various outbuildings and offices
were quickly adapted to the reception of patients.</p>

<p>But the hospital had at that date been working quietly
and effectually for above fourteen years. Fourteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
years before its inauguration in Gray's Inn Road, this
"free" hospital, which was not then "royal," had been
commenced in Greville Street, Hatton Garden, and the
immediate incident which led to its foundation is so
suggestive, so inseparable from the recollection of the
want which it was designed to alleviate, and from its
own generous recognition of the unfailing freedom of
true charity, that it might well be the subject of a memorial
picture. Alas! it would be a tragic reminder of
those days before any provision was made for extending
medical aid to sufferers who had no credentials save
humanity and their own deep necessity. It would be a
grim reminder to us, also, that some of our great charities
established for the relief of the sick are still trammelled
with those restrictions which demand recommendations,
to obtain which the applicant is often condemned
to delay and disappointment. It would show
us that our hospitals are not yet free.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who can remember the entrance
to the broad highway of Holborn nearly fifty years ago&mdash;stay,
that is going back beyond probable acknowledgment,&mdash;let
me say those of us who knew Smithfield when
it was a cattle market, who had heard of "Cow Cross,"
and been told of the terrible purlieux of Field Lane;
who had occasionally caught a glimpse of that foul
wilderness of courts that clustered about the Fleet Ditch;
had read of Mr. Fagin, when "Oliver Twist" was first
appearing in chapters, and had dim recollections of
nursery tales about Bartlemy fair and "hanging morning"
at the Old Bailey; those of us who remember the
cries of drovers, and the lowing and bleating of herds
and flocks in the streets on Sunday nights; the terrible
descent of Snow Hill; the confusion and dismay of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
passengers and vehicles on the steep incline of Holborn
Hill; the reek of all that maze of houses and hovels
that lay in the valley; those of us, in short, who can
carry our memories back for a few years beyond the
time when the new cattle market was built at Islington,
the pens and lairs of Smithfield demolished, the whole
Holborn valley dismantled, only a remnant, a mere
corner, of Field Lane being left standing after the great
viaduct was built&mdash;can imagine what the church of St.
Andrew was like when, with its dark and dreary churchyard,
it stood on the slope of Holborn Hill, instead of
being as it now is in a kind of subway. That churchyard,
with its iron gate, was reached by stone steps,
which were receptacles for winter rain and summer dust,
the straw from waggons, the shreds and sweepings from
adjacent shops, the dirt and refuse of the streets.</p>

<p>On those steps a young girl was seen lying one night,
in the winter of 1827&mdash;lying helpless, lonely, perishing
of disease and famine.</p>

<p>The clocks of St. Andrew, St. Sepulchre, St. Paul,
had clanged and boomed amidst the hurry and the turmoil
of the throng of passengers; had clanged and
boomed till their notes might be heard above the subsiding
roar of vehicles, and the shuffling of feet, till
silence crept over the great city, and more distant chimes
struck through the murky air, tolling midnight. Still
that figure lay upon the cruel stones, under the rusty
gate of the churchyard, as though, unfriended and unpitied
by the world, she waited for admission to the only
place in which she might make a claim in death, if not
in life.</p>

<p>Not more than eighteen years old, she had wandered
wearily from some distant place where fatal instalments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
of the wages of sin had done their work. She had come
to London unknown, unnoted, to die. That she had come
from afar is but a surmise; she may have been a dweller
in this great city, lost amidst the stony desert of its
streets, friendless with the friendlessness of the outcast
or the wretched, to whom the acquaintances of to-day
have little care or opportunity to become the solacers
of to-morrow; she may have crept to that dark corner
by the churchyard gate, amongst the rack and refuse of
the street, as a place in which she, the unconsidered
waste and refuse of our boasted civilisation, could most
fitly huddle from the cold. She was not left actually to
die there, but two days afterwards she passed out of the
world where she had been unrecognised. Not without
result, however.</p>

<p>Among those who had witnessed the distressing occurrence
was a surgeon, Mr. William Marsden, who for
some time before had repeatedly seen cause to lament,
that with all our endowed hospitals, our great medical
schools, and the advance of scientific knowledge, the
sick poor could only obtain relief by means of letters of
recommendation and other delay, until the appointed
days for admission. The sight that he had witnessed
awoke him to fresh energy. He determined to establish
a medical charity, where destitution or great poverty
and disease should be the only necessary credentials for
obtaining free and <i>immediate</i> relief. His honest benevolent
purpose did not cool; in February in the following
year (1828), the house in Greville Street was open
as a free hospital, and it was taken under the royal
patronage of George IV., the Duke of Gloucester becoming
its president.</p>

<p>King William IV. succeeded George IV. as the patron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
of this free hospital, and one of the earliest manifestations
of the interest of our Queen in public charitable
institutions was the expressed desire of her Majesty to
maintain the support which it had hitherto received,
and to confer upon it the name of the <i>Royal</i> Free Hospital.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that the late Duke of Sussex
took a very strong interest in this charity, and at his
death it was determined to erect a new wing, to be
called "the Sussex" wing. This work was completed
in 1856; and in 1863, by the aid of a zealous and indefatigable
chairman of the committee, above £5,000 was
raised by special appeal for the purposes of buying the
freehold of the entire building, so that it is now, in every
sense, a free hospital, with a noble history of suffering
relieved, of the sick healed, the deserted reclaimed, the
sinful succoured, and those that were ready to perish
snatched from the jaws of death.</p>

<p>Since the foundation of the modest house in Hatton
Garden in 1828 above a million and a half of poor sick
and destitute patients have obtained relief, and the
average of poor patients received within its wards is
now 1,500 annually, while 45,000 out-patients resort
thither from all parts of London. The relief thus
afforded costs some £8,000 a year, and this large sum
has to be provided by appeals to the public for those
contributions by which alone the continued effort can
be sustained.</p>

<p>Standing here within the "Moore" ward, so called
after the energetic chairman before referred to, I cannot
think of any appeal that should be more successful in
securing public sympathy than these two statements&mdash;First,
that many of the inmates have been immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
received on their own application; and secondly, that,
bearing in mind the sad story which is, as it were, the
story of the foundation of the hospital, this ward is occupied
by women. Many of them are persons of education
and refinement, who yet would have no asylum if
they had not been received within these sheltering walls,
others may be poor, ignorant, and perhaps even degraded,
but divine charity is large enough to recognise in these
the very need which such an effort is intended to alleviate.
Here at least is a peaceful retreat, where in quiet
reflection, in grateful recognition of mercies yet within
reach, in the sound of pitying voices, and the touch of
sympathetic hands, the weary may find rest, the throes
of pain may be assuaged.</p>

<p>Here are the two fundamental rules of the hospital,
and they form what one might call a double-barrelled
appeal not to be easily turned aside:&mdash;</p>

<div class="casenote">

 <p class="center">IN-DOOR PATIENTS.</p>

 <p>Foreigners, strangers, and others, in sickness or disease, having
 neither friends nor homes, are admitted to the Wards of this Hospital
 on their own application, so far as the means of the charity will
 permit.</p>

 <p class="center">OUT-DOOR PATIENTS.</p>

 <p>All sick and diseased persons, having no other means of obtaining
 relief, may attend at this Hospital every day at Two o'clock, when they
 will receive Medical and Surgical Advice and Medicine free.</p>

</div>

<p>Even while I read the latter announcement the out-patients
are assembling in the waiting-room, on the
right of the quadrangle; the dispenser, in his repository
of drugs, surrounded by bottles, jars, drawers, and all
the appliances for making up medicines, has set his
assistants to work, and is himself ready to begin the
afternoon's duty; the consulting-physician of the day
has just taken his seat in one plain barely-furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
apartment, the consulting-surgeon in another, while the
resident house-surgeon has completed his first inspection
of in-patients, and is ready with particulars of new cases.</p>

<p>These rooms, where patients assemble, and doctors
consult, are on the right of the pleasant quadrangle, with
its large centre oval garden plot, containing a double
ring of trees; and here also is the reception room for
"accidents" and urgent cases&mdash;a very suggestive room,
with styptics, immediate remedies, and prompt appliances
ready to hand, but like all the rest of the official portion
of the building, very plain and practical, with evidence
of there being little time to regard mere ease or ornament,
and of a disregard of anything which is not associated
with the work that has to be done. It is the
same with other apartments, where it is obvious that no
unnecessary expenditure is incurred for mere official show.</p>

<p>The business of the place is to heal by means of food,
of rest, and of medicine, and there, on the left of the
quadrangle, a flight of steps leads downwards to a wide
area, where, in the kitchens, the domestic servants are
busy clearing up, after serving the eighty-eight rations
which have been issued for dinner&mdash;rations of fish, flesh,
and fowl, or those "special diets" which are taken under
medical direction. There is something about this kitchen,
the store-rooms, and offices, with the steps leading thereto,
and the cat sitting blinking in the sun, which irresistibly
reminds me of the heights of Dover and some portion of
the barrack building there; the old military look of the
place clings to this Gray's Inn Road establishment still,
and the visitor misses the wonderful appliances and
mechanical adaptations of some more modern institutions,
not even lifts to convey the dinners to the wards
being possible in such an edifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
There is some compensating comfort in noting, however,
that the nursing staff is so organised as to secure
personal attention to the patients, and that the arrangements
are touchingly homely, not only in regard to the
simple furniture, the few pictures and engravings, and
the little collection of books that are to be found in the
wards, but also in the matter of sympathetic, motherly,
and sisterly help, which is less ceremonious, but not less
truly loving, than is to be found in some places of higher
pretensions.</p>

<p>Here, on the ground floor, the twenty-two beds of the
men's severe accident ward are always full, and some of
the cases are pitiable, including maiming by machinery,
railway accidents, or injury in the streets. The "Marsden
Ward," adjoining is devoted to injuries of a less serious
kind, so that there many of the patients can help themselves.
In the women's accident ward there are three or
four children, one of whom, a pretty chubby-faced little
girl of five years old, has not yet got over her astonishment
at having been run over by a cab the day before
yesterday, picked up and brought into this great room
where most of the people are in bed, only to hear that
she is more frightened than hurt, and is to go home tomorrow.
There are some other little creatures, however,
suffering from very awkward accidents, and they seem to
be petted and made much of, just as they are in the
women's sick ward above, where a delicate-faced intelligent
girl, herself improving greatly under prompt treatment
for an early stage of phthisis, is delighted to have a
little companion to tea with her at her bed-side, the
child being allowed to sit up in a chair, and the pair of
invalids being evidently on delightfully friendly terms.
There is a lower ward, with half a dozen little beds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
devoted solely to children, who are, I think, all suffering
from some form of disease of the joints. Alas! this
class of disease comes of foul dwellings, of impure or
stinted food, of want of fresh air and water; and it brings
a pang to one's heart to note the smiling little faces, the
bright beaming eyes, the pretty engaging grateful ways
of some of these little ones, and yet to know how long a
time it must be before the results of the evil conditions
of their lives will be remedied at the present rate of procedure;
how difficult a problem it is to provide decent
dwellings for the poor, in a city where neighbourhoods such
as that which we have just traversed have grown like
fungi, and cannot be uprooted without pain and loss which
social reformers shrink from inflicting. Thinking of this,
and of all that I have seen in this Royal Free Hospital,
I am glad to carry away from it the picture of this child's
ward and its two young nurses, though I could wish that
the walls of that and all the other wards were a little
brighter with more pictures, that a fresh supply of books
might soon be sent to replenish the library, and that the
flowers, that are so eagerly accepted to deck the tables
of those poor sick rooms, and carry thither a sense of
freshness, colour, and beauty, may come from the gardens
and greenhouses of those who can spare of their abundance.
To keep the eighty-eight beds full requires constant
dependence on public contributions, and yet when
we think of the work that is going on here, not the
eighty-eight only, but the whole number of 102 should
be ready for applicants, who would, even then, be far too
numerous to be received at once in a hospital which,
with a royal freedom of well-doing, sets an example that
might be hopefully followed by other and wealthier
charities for healing the sick.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">What</span>
is the first greeting which a convict receives
when he or she is discharged from
prison?</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, the shivering, shrinking,
bewildered feeling of the man or woman who, after,
undergoing a term of penal servitude, some of it passed in
hours of solitary confinement, has all this great city suddenly
opened again, with its wilderness of streets, its
crowd of unfamiliar faces, its tremendous temptations, its
few resources for the friendless and the suspected, its
great broad thoroughfares, where on every side may be
seen evidences of wealth and plenty; where the tavern
and the gin-shop offer a temporary solace to the wretched;
and where, also, in every neighbourhood, there are evil
slums in which vice finds companionship, and the career
of dishonesty and crime can be resumed without difficulty
or delay.</p>

<p>Those who have stood outside the walls of Clerkenwell
or Coldbath Fields prison, and have watched the
opening of the gates whence prisoners emerge into a
freedom which is almost paralysing in its first effects,
will tell you how the appearance of these poor wretches
is greeted in low muttered tones by silent slouching men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
and women who await their coming. How, after very
few words of encouragement and welcome, they are taken
off to some adjacent public-house, there to celebrate
their liberation; and how, almost before a word is spoken,
the male prisoner is provided with a ready-lighted pipe
from the mouth of one of his former companions, in order
that he may revive his sense of freedom by the long-unaccustomed
indulgence in tobacco.</p>

<p>I should be very sorry to cavil at these marks of
sympathy. They are eminently human. They do not
always mean direct temptation&mdash;that is to say, they
are not necessarily intended to induce the recipient to
resume the evil course which has led to a long and severe
punishment. That the result should be a gradual, if not
an immediate, weakening of that remorse which is too
frequently sorrow for having incurred the penalty rather
than repentance of the sin that led to it, is obvious
enough; but what else is to be expected? Not many
men or women come out of gaol with a very robust
morality. Without entering into the question how far
our present system of prison discipline and management
is calculated to influence the moral nature of culprits
who are under punishments for various crimes, scarcely
ever classified, and never regarded in relation to the
particular circumstances under which they are committed
or the character and disposition, the social status, or the
mental and moral condition of the offender, it may be
broadly and barely stated that our penal legislation is
not effectual in promoting the reclamation of the
criminal.</p>

<p>Even if some determination to begin life anew, to
avoid associations that have led to infamy and disgrace
to accept any labour anywhere in order to obtain an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
honest subsistence, has been working in the mind of a
convict during the period of imprisonment, and under
the advice and remonstrance of the chaplain and the
governor, what is to sustain such half-formed resolutions?
Supposing even that the discharged prisoner has been so
amenable to the regulations of the gaol that he or she
has had placed to the credit account that weekly "good-conduct
money," which, when the term of punishment
has ended, amounts to a sum sufficient to provide for
immediate necessities, where is employment to be looked
for? In what quarter is the owner of a few shillings&mdash;which
may have to last a week or more&mdash;to seek a lodging
and a meal, and that companionship which must be
one of the keenest longings of the newly-released and
yet solitary and half-dazed creature, who is ready to receive
with grateful avidity any friendly greeting that
promises relief from the long monotony of the gaol?</p>

<p>Surely, then, there can be few conditions which appeal
more forcibly to Christian beneficence than that of the
captive who is released after having undergone a sentence
of penal servitude, part of which has been passed in
solitary confinement. Whatever may have been the
impressions made upon the mind during the period of
punishment, and the influence exercised by instruction
or exhortation, the very fact of regaining liberty, the
excitement of freedom, and the uncertainty of the first
steps a man or woman is to take outside the prison walls,
will always involve a danger, before which a very large
proportion of released convicts will succumb.</p>

<p>What, then, is being done in order to extend a helping
hand to these, who are among the most destitute
and unfortunate; who, even if they have relatives, may
be ashamed to seek their aid, or are doubtful of the reception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
that awaits them, while the only companionship
which they can claim at once, and without question, is
that which will surround them with almost irresistible incentives
to a lawless life?</p>

<p>In the very centre of this vast metropolis, at the point
where its great highways converge, and yet in a modest
quiet house standing a little back from the roar and turmoil
of the main street, we shall find what we seek.
Here, on the doorpost of No. 39, Charing Cross, is the
name of "The Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society," and
in two or three offices on the first floor&mdash;one of which is,
in fact, a reception-room for the discharged prisoners
themselves&mdash;the work for which there is such a constant
and pressing need is steadily carried on, under the
direction of a very distinguished committee, of whom
the treasurer is the Hon. Arthur Kinnaird, and the first
honorary secretary, Mr. W. Bayne Ranken, who is assisted
by Mr. S. Whitbread and Mr. L. T. Cave. In looking
at the names of the gentlemen who are concerned in
this admirable effort, you will have noticed that some of
them are also associated with other charitable organisations
which we have visited together, and notably with
those of that Soho district where we last joined in the
musical diversions of the Newport Market Refuge. As
we enter this front office at Charing Cross, we have a
pleasant reminder of that occasion, for we are welcomed
by the indefatigable performer on the cornet, who, when
we last met him, was making "the hills resound" in the
upper room of the old slaughter-house, and carrying all
his juvenile military band with him in one resonant outburst
of harmony that awoke the echoes as far as Seven
Dials. To-day he is carrying out his ordinary secretarial
and managerial duties, as officially representing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
Society, about which he can give us some information
worth hearing.</p>

<p>But there are other visitors for whom preparation has
already been made in the next room&mdash;men dressed decently,
and yet having a certain furtive, unaccustomed
bearing, as though they were not at the moment quite
used to their clothes or to public observation. Some of
them are not without a truculent half-defiant expression
lurking beneath their subdued demeanour; others have
an open, keen outlook; and a few others, again, both in
the shape of their head and the peculiar shifty expression
of eye and mouth, and one might also say of hand,
would at once be characterised by the experienced observer
of London life as men who had "been in trouble"
more than once. On the table of the front office the
object which has at once attracted our attention is a perfectly
new carpenter's basket containing a decent set of
tools, and the man for whom it is intended will be here
for it by-and-by to take it away, just as the shoemaker
who has just gone out has carried with him "a kit," with
which, in addition to a little stock of money, he is about
to begin the world afresh, under the auspices of his friends,
one of whom&mdash;either a member of the committee, or the
secretary, or one of the visiting agents&mdash;will keep him
in view, and give him an occasional encouraging call
while he remains in the metropolitan district. If a situation
should be found for him in the provinces, either
the clergyman of the district, or some other friend of the
Society, is informed of his previous history, and has a
sincere interest in his well-doing. In no case have the
London police anything whatever to do with watching
or inspecting discharged prisoners under the care of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
Society; and, on the other hand, it is a standing rule
that where situations are found for these men and women,
the employers are informed of their previous history,
though any recommendation of the Society may be regarded
as a strong inference that their <i>protégé</i> is trying to
redeem lost character.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that a report of each of those
who are under the care of the Society is made at the
office once a month, either by the man or woman in person,
or by one of the visiting agents or correspondents
of the committee of management; and that, though
the police are forbidden to interfere with them, except
on strong suspicion that they are about to commit a
crime, the most accurate and careful record of their mode
of life and conduct is kept at the offices of the Society.
Should they fail to observe the regulations which the
Society demands, they are liable to police surveillance
instead of friendly, encouraging, and confidential visitation;
and it needs scarcely be said that this liability is
often of itself sufficient to make them desire to retain
the aid and protection which has been extended to them.</p>

<p>From a long and tolerably intimate observation of the
lower strata of the London population, and of the results
of various methods adopted to check the progress
of crime, I am convinced that what is called police surveillance,
as it is conducted in this country, is altogether
mischievous in relation to any probable reformation of
the offender. Even if it be denied (as it has been) that
it is a practice of police-constables to give to persons
employing a discharged prisoner, information conveyed
in such a way as to lead to the loss of employment and
despair of obtaining an honest living, it is quite certain
that the constant dread of being branded as a returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
felon, and the hopeless dogged temper which such a condition
produces, must be enormous obstacles to true reclamation.
The man who could really surmount them
must, whatever may have been his casual crime, be possessed
of a hardy and indomitable desire for virtue
which should challenge our profound respect.</p>

<p>But, apart from what may be called legitimate surveillance
of convicts by the police, it is unfortunately notorious
that members of "the force," who occupy positions
as detectives, or "active and intelligent officers," employ
agents of their own to bring them information, and that
these agents, being men of bad character&mdash;frequently
thieves&mdash;are interested for their own safety's sake in providing
"charges," or "putting up cases," by conveying
information of suspected persons. This is according to
the old evil traditions that have descended to constables
from the time of Jonathan Wild, and probably earlier;
but it is obvious that where such nefarious tools are employed
for obtaining evidence which will suffice to sustain
a charge and convict a prisoner, there is constant danger
to those who, having been once sentenced for crime, are
not only peculiarly liable to be drawn into fresh offences,
but are, from their position, easily made the victims of
cunningly-laid traps for their re-arrest, on a suspicion
that is readily endorsed, because of their previous conviction
and the knowledge of all their antecedents.</p>

<p>It is the removal of discharged prisoners from this probability,
and from the kind of interposition that forbids
their return to the paths of honesty, and so actually produces
"a criminal class," that is, in my opinion, the best
distinction of a Society like this.</p>

<p>Some of the volumes of interesting records which are
preserved here would probably doubtless confirm this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
view. Let us refer to one only, where a nobleman
residing in London had engaged a butler who went to
him with a very excellent character, and in whom he had
the greatest confidence. Happening to have occasion to
employ a detective constable on some business, his lordship
was dismayed at receiving from that astute officer
the intelligence that his trusted servant had once been
sentenced to five years' penal servitude for some dishonest
act, but had been liberated on a ticket-of-leave.
Puzzled how to proceed, the nobleman had the good
sense to apply for advice to this Society, where it was
discovered that the representation of the detective was
true enough, and that the man had been recommended
to a situation by the Society itself, an intimation of his
antecedents being given to the employer. In that situation
he had remained for several months, without the
least fault being brought against him, and he then
applied for and obtained the vacant and more lucrative
appointment in the family of his lordship, who, though he
acknowledged he should not have engaged him had he
known of his previous fault and its punishment, kept his
secret, and retained him in his service, where he remained
at the time of the last report, respected by the
household, and faithfully fulfilling his duties.</p>

<p>Probably this was one of those cases where, yielding
to sudden temptation, a man incurs for a single crime
punishment that awakens moral resolution; and it must
be remembered that there are many convicts who, while
in prison they are practically undistinguished from the
habitual or the repeated criminal, or from the convict of
brutalised, undeveloped, or feeble moral nature, are in
danger of being utterly ruined because of a single and
perhaps altogether unpremeditated offence, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
they may bitterly repent. The feeling of shame, of
humiliation, of doubt as to any but a cold and deterrent
reception by former friends, the dread of scorn, derision,
or abhorrence, may lead such men or women to abandon
as hopeless any expectation of resuming their former
avocations, or even of once more attaining a respectable
position. To such as these the Society offers such aid
as may keep them from the despondency that destroys;
and in every case, even in that of the wretch who has
been convicted again and again, it holds out some
hope of reformation. That there is some such hope
may be learned from the fact, that even thieves&mdash;"habitual
criminals"&mdash;do not, as a rule, bring their own
children up to dishonesty, and are often careful to conceal
from them the means by which they live. The
ranks of crime are not so largely augmented from the
children of dishonest parents (though, of course, evil
example bears its dreadful results) as from the neglected
children of our great towns.</p>

<p>But let us see what are the means adopted by the
Society for helping discharged prisoners. Of course the
procedure must begin with the prisoners themselves, in
so far that they must express their willingness to accept
the aid offered to them, and make known their decision
to the governor of the prison where they are confined,
and where the rules and provisions of the Society are
displayed and explained.</p>

<p>This refers to the convict prisons, since only these are
eligible, the prisoners from county gaols being assisted
by other organisations; therefore, discharged convicts
from Millbank, Pentonville, Portland, Portsmouth, Chatham,
Parkhurst, Dartmoor, Woking, and Brixton, are
able to seek help; and it is gratifying to know that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
according to the prison returns, of 1,579 male prisoners
discharged from these places in one year, 796 sought aid
from this and local provincial societies having the same
object, the number of applicants to the London Society
being 524, or nearly two-thirds of the whole.</p>

<p>On any convict, male or female, accepting the offer of
the Society, and making that decision known to the
governor of the prison, the latter forwards to this office
at Charing Cross a printed document, or recommendation,
stating full particulars of the prisoner's age, date of
conviction, number of previous convictions (if any), degree
of education, religion, former trade or employment,
ability to perform labour, and general character while in
prison, together with the amount of good-conduct money
which is to be allowed for work performed during the period
of incarceration. This good-conduct money may amount
to a maximum sum of £3, and the Society takes charge
of it for the benefit of the prisoner, disbursing it only as
it may be required, and supplementing it, when necessary,
by a further grant of money, or even by advances or
loans as may be deemed desirable in certain cases.</p>

<p>These reports from the prison governor reach the office
about six weeks before the discharge of the convicts
named in them, and following them come other papers,
each of which contains a graphic personal description of
the prisoner referred to, and a fairly-executed photograph,
which is usually not without certain striking characteristics,
though you will be surprised to find how often you
fail to discover the lineaments which you have associated
in fancy with lawlessness and crime. At the time of
their discharge, the men and women are conducted hither
by a plainly-clothed messenger from the prison, appointed
for the purpose, and take their places in yonder back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
room, where they are immediately identified by means of
the descriptions and photographs, and are then questioned
as to their capabilities and the particular employment in
which they desire to engage. It is manifestly impossible
that the Society can provide them with employment in
the particular trades which they may previously have
followed, since there may be no openings in those industries,
or they may be such as would be obviously unsuitable
for persons who are still on probation.</p>

<p>Should the prisoner have friends or relatives able and
willing to receive or assist him, they are communicated
with, but should he be entirely dependent on personal
exertion, the agent or secretary at once procures for him
a decent outfit of clothes, and a lodging as far as possible
from the scene of his former companions. A small sum
of money is advanced for immediate subsistence, and he
usually has employment provided for him, either in a
situation, at manual labour, or by being set up in a
small way at shoemaking, tailoring, or carpentering, either
as journeyman, or, where possible, on his own account.</p>

<p>From six to twenty prisoners at a time are discharged
from one or other of the convict establishments and
brought to the Society's offices, and of the younger men
a considerable proportion are assisted to go to sea, others&mdash;but,
alas! too few&mdash;to emigrate, while a number obtain
work as builders and contractors' labourers; and others
again resume former occupations, as potmen, waiters, or
employés in various situations, where the masters are
always (if they take them on the recommendation of the
Society) fully apprised of their position. A good many
are set up again as costermongers, and in that case the
agent of the Society quietly accompanies them to market,
and advances the money for their first purchases; others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
go into the country and obtain work, and not a few of
the better-educated or more skilled soon obtain engagements
of various kinds, by personal application, and
without reference to the Society, though they continue to
report themselves, and to be kept in view by the agents,
and, being separated from evil companionship, and feeling
that they are not altogether friendless, retrieve their
position and regain an honourable reputation.</p>

<p>Of 514 men and women who were received by the
Society during the year, 180 obtained employment in
London and are doing well; 156 were sent to places
beyond the metropolitan district, and were placed under
the supervision of the local police; 32 were sent to relatives
and friends abroad; 57 obtained berths on board ship; 50
had failed to report and notify their change of address
as required by Act of Parliament; 23 had been re-convicted;
6 were not satisfactorily reported on; one had
died; and 9, who had been recently discharged at the
end of the year, were waiting for employment at the time
of the Report. To read the Report Book, recording the
visits of the agents or secretary to men employed in
various avocations, and to their friends or relatives, is
very encouraging, for it shows that of a large proportion,
say seventy per cent., there is a good hope of reclamation
by their long continuance in industrious efforts to
retain their situations and to work honestly in various
callings; while the reports of country cases by clergymen
in the provinces is equally satisfactory, especially as
they frequently record the return of the former convict
to his family and friends, amidst whom he earns an
honourable subsistence.</p>

<p>The female convicts, who are also received at the office,
are, if they cannot be sent to relatives and friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
mostly taken to a Refuge, which has been established by
the Society at Streatham, where they find a home until
situations can be obtained for them; and it is to the
credit of some earnest ladies who are willing to engage
these discharged prisoners as domestic servants that the
result is often most favourable. A very large proportion
of the women return to friends, however. Of 53 who
left the Refuge at Streatham last year, 30 were received
by friends, 18 obtained situations, 3 returned to Millbank
Penitentiary, 1 emigrated, and 1 died, 25 remaining at
the Refuge at the time of the report.</p>

<p>In the case of these discharged female prisoners, as
well as for the sake of those men who would eagerly
seize an opportunity of beginning life anew in a new
country, it would be most desirable if greater facilities
existed for promoting and assisting the emigration of
such as gave satisfactory evidence of reformation of
character. The Society finds its own funds, supported
by contributions from the public, barely sufficient to
maintain, and insufficient largely to extend its useful
work. One of the committee, a resident in Canada, has
rendered invaluable assistance to emigrants recommended
to his notice by the Society. The governor of Dartmoor
Prison in his Report, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot too strongly again express my conviction
that an emigration scheme connected with the Aid
Societies would be an invaluable aid to the restoration of
many casual criminals to a position of respectability and
honesty. It would be especially appreciated by those
(unfortunately a too numerous class) who had incurred
the shorter sentences of penal servitude as punishments
for breaches of trust of various kinds. These men are
often cast off by their respectable friends, and, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
shortness of their sentences, are unable to earn the additional
gratuity. With no lasting means of subsistence,
and an overstocked market for their labour, it is not to
be wondered at if such men speedily add a second
conviction to their criminal career." Let us trust that
practical steps will be taken to remove this difficulty.</p>

possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
